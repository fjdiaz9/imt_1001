Completo":{"0":"SANTIAGO, May 30 (Reuters) - Chile hopes to start negotiations soon with Albemarle (ALB.N) as part of the government's plan to gain majority control of lithium mining projects, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said on Tuesday. The plan was launched in April to acquire control of new strategic projects and the company's current operations in the Atacama. \"They (Albemarle) have only verbally stated that their interest is to start negotiations as soon as possible,\" Hernando told reporters after a presentation of a report on lithium price and production projections. In a statement sent to Reuters, the minister clarified that state-owned copper miner Codelco had been assigned to handle the talks and that the government would respect the current contract which ends in 2043. Codelco recently started talks with SQM about its contract which expires in 2030. \"Although I would like it to be as soon as possible, what is clear is that the State will fully respect the current contracts and the negotiations to reach a public-private partnership will take place in a period close to the end of the contract in 2043,\" Hernando said. Albemarle declined to comment. Albemarle said earlier this month it was open to renegotiating its lithium contract in Chile before 2043, but planned to do so towards the end of its contract and would seek access to more deposits in the South American country.","1":"SANTIAGO, May 19 (Reuters) - Chilean state miner Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, said on Friday it had created two subsidiaries to run a newly mandated lithium business amid a government plan to increase state control over the industry. The government instructed Codelco in April to begin talks with companies running lithium mining operations in Chile's Atacama salt flats as part of a new lithium strategy that will see the state take majority stakes in all \"strategic\" projects. As well as talks with the world's two largest lithium miners, Albemarle (ALB.N) and SQM (SQMA.SN), Codelco has also been tasked by President Gabriel Boric's government with developing new alliances. In a statement Codelco said a new subsidiary, Salares de Chile SpA, would operate its lithium activities while another, Minera Tarar SpA, would focus on the Atacama salt flats and possible partnerships with private firms operating there. Maximo Pachecho, the current chair of Codelco's board of directors, was named chairman of both companies, with Eduardo Bitran, who had led negotiations over contracts with Albemarle and SQM some years earlier, as vice-president. Economy Minister Nicolas Grau said in an interview with Reuters that the government expects to close negotiations with the existing Atacama miners before March 2026, when the current government's term comes to an end. On Thursday, SQM said it expected to begin talks with Codelco in the coming weeks.","2":"MEXICO CITY, May 18 (Reuters) - Chile's lithium miner SQM is set to start talks about lithium projects with state miner Codelco in the coming weeks, the firm's Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Ramos told analysts in a quarterly earnings call on Thursday. Ramos said the exact dates would soon be shared with the market. The Chilean government had in April announced plans for stronger state control of the metal, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, which would involve allowing private sector partnerships only if the government holds a majority stake in strategic projects. SQM, the world's second-largest lithium producer, saw its lithium sales volumes slip 15% over the first three months of 2023, according to a presentation, but average prices surged 34% ahead of their level in the same quarter a year earlier. SQM had reported prices of around $38,000 per metric tonne in the first quarter of 2022, though this rose to $59,000 per tonne by the last quarter. It did not specify quarterly prices in its latest report. \"We are positive about volumes for the second quarter and semester,\" Ramos said when asked about the company's outlook, citing a ramp up of activity in China. \"The second quarter is showing a more stable pattern,\" he said. SQM's revenues landed at $2.26 billion for January to March, up almost 12% from a year earlier, though profits dipped 6%.","3":"May 17 (Reuters) - Chile's SQM (SQMA.SN), the world's second-largest lithium producer, said on Wednesday that its first-quarter net profit slid almost 6% compared to the year-ago period to total nearly $750 million. Revenue for the miner landed at $2.26 billion during the January-to-March period, up almost 12% compared to revenue during last year's first quarter as sale prices rose. Specifically, SQM reported that average lithium sales prices jumped by more than a third, or 34%, during the three-month period. The miner, which mostly ships cargos of the ultra-light white metal to buyers in Asia, posted quarterly revenue of $1.65 billion for lithium and its derivatives, a jump of nearly 14% from the year-earlier period. But sales volumes edged down in the quarter by about the same rate, or down 15%, according to the company. Advanced purchases in the previous quarter and high levels of stock across the battery supply chain led to a weaker demand, predominantly in China, SQM'S Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Ramos said in a statement. He added that the weaker demand was offset by the higher prices. Ramos noted the firm expects sales volumes to recover in the year's second quarter. Adjusted earnings before interests, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) hit $1.08 billion, down more than 8% from the same three months in 2022. Last month, President Gabriel Boric announced a proposal for Chile to pursue a state-led development model for the coveted battery metal, allowing partnerships with the private sector but only if the government holds a majority stake in new lithium ventures. The proposal still awaits a vote in Congress. In a statement shortly after Boric's announcement, SQM said it would need to invest an additional $2 billion under the new strategy.","4":"SANTIAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Chile's lower house of Congress gave final approval on Wednesday for a long-awaited mining tax reform that now requires only the signature of leftist President Gabriel Boric, who has publicly backed it, to become law. The reform will require large copper and lithium producers that operate in the mineral-rich Latin American nation to pay more taxes and royalties to the government. Chile is the world's top copper producer and No. 2 in lithium, both seen as key to making future fleets of electric vehicles powered by rechargeable batteries. By a vote of 101 in favor to 24 against, lawmakers approved modifications to the tax and royalty bill endorsed by the Senate last week. The lopsided vote was hailed by Finance Minister Mario Marcel, who underscored that the higher government take required of mining companies would address past abuses. \"With this legislation, we seek to avoid what happened many times with our country's natural riches: they were exploited, they disappeared, which left very little for the country and its future development,\" Marcel told reporters after the vote. Under the reform, the top tax rate will reach up to nearly 47% for companies that produce over 80,000 tonnes of fine copper a year, considered high by the industry. It also establishes a 1% ad valorem tax on copper sales from companies that sell more than 50,000 tonnes of fine copper, as well as an additional 8% to 26% tax depending on the miner's operating margin. Mining association Sonami expressed relief that the measure ended uncertainty over the type of reform lawmakers would ultimately adopt. \"Uncertainty lasted for almost five years and, without a doubt, hurt the country's main productive activity,\" Sonami said in a statement. The association described the final legislative language as \"better\" than what was initially proposed by the government, giving credit to Marcel for enacting industry-friendly revisions.","5":"SANTA JUANA, Chile, May 14 (Reuters) - In the southern Chilean city of Santa Juana, hit hard by wildfires earlier this year, locals have a special taskforce helping fight blazes: a herd of goats. The goats have already saved the native forest of the Bosques de Chacay once, preventing the park from being consumed by February forest fires - fueled by heatwaves and a punishing drought - that left dozens dead, thousands injured and almost 440,000 hectares destroyed in south-central Chile. \"The park was surrounded by fires, but it ended up being the only green spot left,\" said Rocio Cruces, cofounder of the 16-hectare (40-acre) park, and \"Buena Cabra,\" a project that uses goats to build firebreaks. The technique, also used in Portugal and Spain, relies on grazing goats to control dry pastures and other vegetation that fuel forest fires in the summer. Goat droppings also help enrich the soil and prevent further erosion. \"The fire reached our forest but only the first line of trees was really affected, less than 10% of the park,\" Cruces said, adding that small fires broke out but did not advance due to minimal brush. Cruces started the project after deadly wildfires in 2017. Her flock has since grown from 16 goats to 150 and she hopes to inspire others to follow suit. \"In Chile we are failing in fire prevention,\" said Francisco Di Napoli, a forestry engineer from the University of Concepcion in Chile who is familiar with the technique, known as \"strategic grazing.\" \"These animals can help us a lot,\" Di Napoli said, adding that other organizations should \"evaluate where it can be applied, find where there's fuel and have the goats eat it.\"","6":"SALAR DE ATACAMA, Chile, May 11 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) hopes to expand its lithium operations in Chile's Atacama salt flat as early as 2028 with direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology under its current government contract, Ignacio Mehech, the company's Chile manager, told Reuters. \"Depending on environmental and other permits needed in Chile, as well as scaling technologies, we believe (DLE) should be implemented, if everything goes well, towards 2028 or 2029,\" Mehech said during an interview at the company's Atacama lithium mining operations. Albemarle and SQM, the only two lithium producers in Chile, currently extract the metal using mass evaporation ponds from brine taken from underground reservoirs. President Gabriel Boric has heavily pushed DLE technology. So far commercially unproven, the method could preserve water tables by allowing brine to be reinjected underground after lithium is extracted. Even so, DLE still requires large volumes of freshwater to filter lithium from underground brine. A DLE process developed by Bill Gates-backed Lilac Solutions, for instance, uses 10 tonnes of water for every tonne of lithium produced. Water is a hot-button topic in Chile, which is suffering a long drought, even more so on the Atacama desert. One of the driest areas of the world, mining water use there can put companies at odds with indigenous communities and threaten flamingo populations and other wildlife. \"We need to get water from other sources,\" Mehech said, adding that Albemarle signed a deal with CRAMSA, a local company looking to build a desalination plant in northern Chile and infrastructure to bring desalinated water to the region. \"If more partners sign on, because our demand isn't enough, we could secure desalinated water for the Atacama basin,\" Mehech said, saying that Albemarle's demands fulfill 500 of the 8,000 liters per second the company needs to supply the area. When it comes to brine reinjection, Mehech said Albemarle secured environmental permits and plans to have completed a reinjection pilot program by the end of the year. \"With the results we generate from that pilot program, we're going to start a second bigger pilot campaign to have more certainty about how reinjection should be done in the Atacama salt flat.\" This would allow the Albemarle to increase lithium production under its current agreement with Corfo, Chile's state development agency the company has a contract with until 2043, he added. Boric announced a sweeping plan last month to take control of the country's lithium industry through state-controlled public-private partnerships. Chile holds the world's largest lithium reserves, but lost its spot as the top producer as the government failed to expand the industry. Countries around the world are racing to provide the metal needed to power electric vehicles. Boric's announcement spooked some investors, sparking interest in competing countries like nearby Argentina. On Wednesday, lithium producers Livent and Allkem announced a $10.6 billion merger with a focus on Argentina. \"If you want high-quality, low-cost lithium, Argentina is the country with the best assets out there,\" said Livent CEO Paul Graves. Both SQM and Albemarle have expressed interest in expanding operations in Chile, but differ on when to start renegotiations. SQM's (SQMA.SN) contract expires in 2030, and the company has indicated it will soon negotiate with Codelco, the state-run copper company tasked with forming the new agreements. Albemarle CEO Kent Masters told Reuters last week he is open to negotiating before 2043 and would monitor how negotiations with SQM develop \"to give us a bit of intelligence.\" Chilean Economy Minister Nicolas Grau told Reuters that conversations in the Atacama salt flat were going to be \"defined during this government,\" which ends in 2026, but Mehech sees a new deal happening beyond that. \"We don't think it's necessary. We've been assured by all government actors that our contract will be respected until 2043,\" Mehech said. \"When it's time, in 2038 or 2040, we'll sit down to negotiate with the state.\"","7":"MEXICO CITY, May 10 (Reuters) - Chile's senate approved on Wednesday a long-awaited new mining royalty bill, passing it back to the lower chamber for a final vote that could come as early as next week. Chile is the world's top copper producer and the bill aims to raise taxes on large copper producers. Earlier this week, the government said it reached an agreement with senators to cut the top tax rate to 46.5% from 47% for companies that produce over 80,000 tonnes of fine copper a year, and 45.5% for production in the 50,000-80,000 range. The bill had initially proposed a ceiling of 50%, but this was brought down repeatedly amid legislative debate and criticism from the mining industry. The bill is part of the government's wider plan to overhaul the country's tax system, a key part of which was shelved by Congress in March. The royalty bill also establishes a 1% ad valorem tax on copper sales from companies whose sales exceed 50,000 tonnes of fine copper, as well as a tax ranging from 8% to 26%, depending on the miner's operating margin. Chile's National Mining Society, known by its Spanish initials Sonami, issued a statement Tuesday saying that even with the adjustments to the original proposal, the bill's total tax burden for the sector remains higher than in competing countries.","8":"SANTIAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - Chile state-owned miner Codelco and multinational miner BHP Group (BHP.AX) signed a knowledge-sharing agreement on sustainable mining, Codelco said in a statement on Tuesday. The \"collaboration accord\" sets up a commission to share expertise between the two companies over the next five years in \"mutual interest areas\" like water use, tailings supervision, and application of advanced technologies, the statement said. \"In order to imagine these new ways of doing mining, innovation is one of the main axes of our management, a focus that we can only develop in alliance with players who are equally active in this search, as is the case with BHP,\" Codelco's CEO Andre Sougarret said in the statement. The statement says the accord will address technologies that enable the exploitation of low-grade minerals, deep deposits and deposits with complex metallurgical conditions, as well as the design of operations that use less or no water. Rag Udd, BHP's Americas president, said the alliance with Codelco reflects the company's efforts to fight climate change. The global mining industry has a track record of environmental abuses, but it is also a key player in the transition to clean energy. Chile is the world's top copper producer and holds the largest lithium reserves on the planet. The World Bank has estimated that the production of minerals, such graphite, lithium and cobalt, may increase by 500% by 2050 to meet demand for clean energy technologies. Chile's government last month announced it would work to transfer control over the country's lithium operations to a state-owned company, with future lithium contracts issued only as public-private partnerships. President Gabriel Boric tasked copper giant Codelco with leading negotiations with lithium producers currently operating in the country. Agreements like Tuesday's accord between Codelco and BHP \"show how joint work between the public-private sector is essential to making mining an increasingly sustainable industry,\" Udd said.","9":"SANTIAGO, May 8 (Reuters) - Chile's new constitution may end up looking a lot like the current text, which dates back to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship - but without his name on it - after the political right took charge of the redraft process in a harsh nationwide electoral defeat for leftist President Gabriel Boric. Chile's Republican Party, led by far-right firebrand Jose Antonio Kast, secured over a third of the national vote on Sunday to elect advisers to draw up the new constitution, a sharp shift from a progressive majority that led the failed first attempt. The win for the right will likely set the foundations for a far more conservative rewrite of the neoliberal original text, which was credited for propelling decades of strong growth in the copper mining nation, but criticized for causing wide economic inequalities that sparked months of social justice protests in 2019. \"This is the right's best chance for people to pick a Pinochet constitution without Pinochet's signature,\" said Patricio Navia a political scientist at New York University. \"If it includes some upgrades and demands from the left, we're going to have a constitution very similar to Pinochet's, but signed by Gabriel Boric and ministers of the Communist Party (part of the governing coalition).\" Boric, a former student protest leader, rose to power representing the Social Convergence Party on a hopeful mandate of reform, pledging to support a major progressive overhaul of the constitution. That process ended in failure last year when voters rejected the proposed new text. Boric and progressives had called for a new democratic drafting process led by citizens with a focus on Indigenous and minority rights, powers of collective bargaining, water and land rights, as well as healthcare, education and pension reforms. This time around, Boric's approval rating has fallen amid concerns about inflation and insecurity. \"The political climate in Chile isn't the same as in 2019 or 2020,\" said political analyst Cristobal Bellolio. \"After a pandemic, and amid an economic and security crisis, people are favoring options that reduce uncertainty.\" That's opened the door to far-right politicians like Kast, a lawyer who lost to Boric in the 2021 presidential elections and has defended the legacy of the brutal Pinochet dictatorship. An estimated 3,200 Chileans were murdered and another 28,000 tortured by the state during Pinochet's rule. Many of the victims were affiliated with the socialist government of Salvador Allende, who was deposed in a 1973 coup. Kast's party won 23 of 50 seats on the new constitutional council, while a separate coalition of conservative parties won 11 seats. With a three-fifths majority needed to pass new articles, the right could push things through on its own. Analysts said, however, that the right would likely agree to some changes to appease voters, including on areas like expanded social rights, consumer protections and Indigenous recognitions. \"The issue is that if it's more right then Pinochet's constitution, people are going to reject it,\" Navia added, who added the loss for Boric left the leader who once promised to bury Chile's market-led model sorely wounded. \"Boric said that if Chile was the cradle of neo-liberalism, it would also be its grave. But neo-liberalism is still healthy and now Boric is in the ICU,\" he said. The loss comes weeks after Boric presented his most-recent ambitious proposal to take control of the country's lithium industry and create a new national lithium company. The plan already faces technical and political challenges as a key part must pass through Congress. Rossana Castiglioni, a political science professor at Diego Portales University in Chile, said she was surprised by the low support for centrist parties and high number of null and blank votes, saying it was a message for progressives in the region. \"It's not enough to win an election, what happens in between is very important,\" Castiglioni said, adding that the economic landscape was very different than a previous leftist tide in Latin America during the economic boom of the early 2000s. \"The lesson is that there has to be a strategic adaption on the left if it wants to win elections in contexts were the economy is more adverse.\"","10":"SANTIAGO, May 7 (Reuters) - Chilean right-wing parties won a majority of votes on Sunday to elect advisers to draft a new constitution, marking a sharp shift from a progressive majority that drafted a failed first constitutional rewrite. With 95.13% of ballots tallied, Chile's Republican Party, led by former conservative firebrand presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast, secured nearly 35% of the vote. A separate coalition of traditional right-wing parties gained just over 20% of the vote, while President Gabriel Boric's left-wing coalition garnered about 29%. Centrist parties took the remainder of the vote. \"Today is the first day of a better future, a new start for Chile,\" Kast, who lost to Boric in 2021, said during a speech in Santiago. \"Chile has defeated a failed government.\" The final results will determine the exact make-up of a 50-seat Constitutional Council that will be in charge of drafting a new constitution. Articles will need a three-fifths majority to be approved. This is the latest step in a years-long effort to overhaul the country's dictatorship-era text after nearly 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020 following violent protests against inequality. The constitutional advisers elected on Sunday will start drawing up a new constitution in June based on a draft compiled by 24 constitutional experts appointed by Congress in March. Voters will then approve or reject the new proposal in December. The first rewrite was drafted by largely independent and left-wing constituents and it focused on social benefits, environmental rights, gender parity and indigenous rights. It was considered one of the world's most progressive constitutions, but many voters found it too polarizing and the process was mired by controversies. Boric, who took office last March, rose to power on a wave of optimism surrounding reform, but his approval ratings have since plummeted as a struggling economy and rising crime have become the main concerns for voters. Boric also suffered a political defeat after throwing his weight behind the first rewrite, which was rejected by nearly 62% of voters. The president has since distanced himself from the process but vowed to support it. \"The government won't meddle with the process and will respect the entity's autonomy in its deliberation,\" Boric told reporters Sunday morning after voting, adding that the government would act as a guarantor and support requests from the new council. After Kast's victory speech, Boric spoke from La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago and called for unity and urged the opposition to learn from the previous failed attempt. \"I want to invite the Republican Party, that's won an unquestionable majority, to not make the same mistakes we made,\" Boric said. \"This process can't be about vendettas, but putting Chile first.\"","11":"SANTIAGO, May 7 (Reuters) - Chile's government said that 115 Venezuelan migrants who had been stranded on the border with Peru were repatriated to Venezuela on a humanitarian flight Sunday. Hundreds of migrants, mostly Venezuelans seeking to return home, had been stranded in the country's northern border after being denied entry into Peru. The incident sparked diplomatic tensions as Peru sent police and soldiers to the border to block migrants. \"It was difficult, I don't wish it on anyone,\" Carliana Bravo, 27, said after arriving to Venezuela with a child in her arms. \"It was 12 days of sleeping in the desert, with cold, a lot of sun during the day and the children got burned and ill.\" Yuri Gil, a 38-year-old stylist, said that several people weren't able to board the flight because they had foreign children. \"Mothers with foreign children didn't get any help, they got left there,\" Gil said. \"Just because their kids are Ecuadorian, Peruvian, they didn't let them through, they didn't leave on the flight. It was horrible.\" Chilean and Venezuelan authorities were not immediately available for comment about migrants not allowed to board the flight. In a statement released earlier on Sunday, Chile's Foreign Ministry said the flight was the result of diplomatic efforts with the Venezuelan government and its \"Return to the Homeland\" plan. \"Diplomatic efforts will continue with the goal of establishing future flights from different parts of Chile,\" the statement said, adding that it would also strengthen regional efforts to deal with the ongoing immigration crisis. \"It's only through cooperation that we'll be able to take on the regional migration crisis in the medium and long term,\" the statement said.","12":"SANTIAGO, May 5 (Reuters) - Chileans will vote to elect 50 constitutional advisers on Sunday, a major step towards rewriting the constitution, after voters overwhelmingly rejected a first attempt in a plebiscite last September to replace the dictatorship-era charter. The so-called Constitutional Council that voters are set to elect will work as of June on the new constitution, based on a preliminary draft prepared by a commission of 24 experts that Congress appointed in March. But some of the 15 million eligible voters shrug when asked about the do-over after the failed push last year to rewrite the constitution, which dates back decades to the era of right-wing military dictator Augusto Pinochet. \"I'm a little tired of the polarization,\" said 31-year-old Paz Villafana, who runs a small publishing firm. \"I voted to approve (in September), I wanted a new constitution and to get rid of the dictatorship's constitution, but now I'm not really interested.\" Following Sunday's election, voters will then head to the polls in December to approve or reject the proposed document, widely expected to be more moderate than the first proposal which would have been one of the world's most progressive constitutions. \"If the first process was highly uncertain, this is much more certain ... It is a more supervised process, with monitoring bodies, experts, lawyers, elected representatives,\" said political analyst Kenneth Bunker. He stressed that traditional political forces are now more in control of the process, unlike the failed first attempt. The new attempt has a shorter time frame. It also includes the expert commission, a technical body acting as arbitrator, and fewer assembly members, equivalent to a third of the dissolved constitutional assembly whose project voters rejected in the plebiscite. The first process was dominated by leftists and independents, while this one is guided by 12 institutional principles that lawmakers agreed to. Public support for the reworked process has waned, after mass protests that started in late 2019 and went on for months provided the political impetus to initiate the push for a constitutional rewrite. The coronavirus pandemic, rising crime, a slowing economy and stubbornly high inflation are more top of mind for most Chileans. President Gabriel Boric, 37, promised ambitious social reforms and rose to power last year on a wave of optimism fueled by hopes over a new progressive constitution. But the former student protest leader has not been as involved in the push for a new overhaul. Nicholas Watson of consultancy Teneo said that three blocs are competing, each one representing different party alliances for the Constitutional Council, in addition to two parties competing under their own banners for votes this Sunday. It seems \"likely that no single bloc or party will win enough seats to independently steer the process without compromise,\" Watson said.","13":"May 4 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) is open to renegotiating its Chile lithium contract before 2043 and would seek access to even more of the country's vast reserves of the metal used to make electric vehicle batteries, CEO Kent Masters told Reuters on Thursday. The decision by Chilean President Gabriel Boric last month to gradually nationalize his country's lithium industry sparked concern that U.S. miner Albemarle and rival SQM (SQMA.SN) could be kicked out of the country, even though officials have stressed they would not tear up existing contracts. While lithium for years has typically been produced using open-pit mines or evaporation ponds, Boric's plan relies on the wide scale deployment of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies that have so far never worked in commercial operations, but which Albemarle and its peers are studying. Albemarle and SQM's contracts only grant access to the Atacama salt flats, or salars, but Boric hopes to open up many other salars across his country for lithium production, a step that will require DLE technologies. \"We've never said there's a hard no in renegotiating before 2043,\" Masters said in an interview. \"Post-2043, or after we renegotiate, the government will be involved, probably as a partner. And we would anticipate even before that having the opportunity to perhaps get even more rights for additional resources.\" Many DLE technologies use lots of potable water and electricity, a limitation that Albemarle has acknowledged and one it is working to limit. None have yet to work independently at commercial scale. Chile and Albemarle could cement their dominant role in the global lithium and EV industries if they can get one or more DLE technology to succeed. Reuters reported last month that SQM plans to begin renegotiations on its contract, which ends in 2030, as soon as next month, a step Masters said he expects to \"give us a bit of intelligence.\" General Motors Co (GM.N), Stellantis NV (STLAM.MI), Standard Lithium Ltd (SLI.V), Rio Tinto Ltd (RIO.AX) and others have made their own DLE bets. Shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle rose about 1% in afternoon trading to $174.04 after jumping more than 6% earlier in the session. Masters and other executives repeatedly downplayed concerns about weakening spot lithium prices in China. \"Lithium demand and the EV market continue to grow at an extraordinary rate,\" Masters said. Masters declined to comment on Australian lithium developer's Liontown Resources Ltd (LTR.AX) rejection in March of Albemarle's $3.7 billion takeover bid.","14":"BUENOS AIRES, May 3 (Reuters) - The Chilean peso is set for a period of stability as economic and political worries continue to fade, validating the central bank's decision to unwind an intervention program implemented last year to calm market turmoil, a Reuters poll showed. In July last year, the peso plunged to a record low of 1,050 per U.S. dollar in reaction to a sharp drop in the price of copper, Chile's top export, that added to concerns over a proposed reform of its market-friendly constitution. But the peso recovered in the second half of 2022 and has settled close to 800 since the start of this year thanks to the rejection of constitutional changes as well as better demand for metals after China reopened its economy. The currency is forecast to remain near 800 in coming months, trading at 811 per dollar in one year, where it was on Tuesday, according to the median estimate of 14 foreign exchange experts surveyed April 28-May 3. \"We stay constructive on the peso versus its emerging market peers, with Chile's imbalances adjusting amid a supportive global environment,\" Barclays foreign exchange strategists wrote in a report last week. Another positive factor for the peso is the refusal by lawmakers to move forward with a tax overhaul devised by the government of President Gabriel Boric to finance reforms in pension and health care systems. Similarly, technical and political challenges could postpone for years any advance in Boric's idea to nationalize the Chilean lithium industry, which holds the world's largest reserves of the metal. The central bank's move last month to start reducing its forward dollar sales operations program \"is quite gradual in nature, and we think it should have limited impact once the news is absorbed,\" Barclays said. In contrast, the outlook for Argentina's peso continues to worsen, facing an additional 50% depreciation to 450 per U.S. dollar in one year in the heavily-regulated official market as the economy teeters on the edge of a deeper crisis. In Brazil, sentiment towards President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's fiscal plans remains broadly neutral, with the Brazilian real , seen trading 2.0% weaker at 5.14 per dollar in one year compared to 5.04 on Tuesday. In Mexico, the peso is set to drop 6.7% in 12 months to 19.25 per dollar from 17.96 this week, reflecting a correction for inflation. Year-to-date it has gained 8.4%, while the real is up 4.9%, the Chilean peso 4.6% and the Argentine peso down 21%.

Hundreds of migrants are stranded at the border, including mostly undocumented Venezuelans, according to the Peruvian police. The migrants say they are seeking to enter Peru to continue their journey back home. Interior Minister Vicente Romero told local radio station RPP that some 390 police officers have already arrived at the border and 300 more soldiers will arrive from different parts of the country to join the surveillance mission. \"We are not going to allow any illegal entry, or attacks on the police,\" he added. The Peruvian government declared a state of emergency on its borders this week to pave the way for joint operations between the military and the police to stop migrants, in a tightening of its immigration policy. The government has threatened that foreigners without the proper paperwork could be expelled. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry summoned the Chilean ambassador in Peru to voice its frustration this week, alleging a lack of Chilean support. The Chilean Foreign Ministry said it had expressed \"discomfort\" over criticism of President Gabriel Boric by a Peruvian mayor. Some 1.5 million Venezuelans live in Peru, most of whom have entered since 2017 when the country granted a temporary residence permit. Many have not formalized their status, according to official data. There are also an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 undocumented migrants in Peru, which has a total population of 33 million.","16":"May 1 (Reuters) - Chile's president Gabriel Boric criticised violence in stadiums after the derby between Universidad de Chile and Universidad Catolica was suspended on Sunday due to disorder, fireworks and noise bombs in the stands of the Estadio Municipal Ester Roa Rebolledo in Concepcion. The National Professional Football Association (ANFP) said they will reschedule the match without spectators, as they will also request a meeting with the President to work against violence. \"We will not let a small group of delinquents take over the stadiums at the expense of the great majority who come to watch a show in peace and joy,\" Boric, who is a Universidad Catolica supporter, said on Twitter. \"We join the words of the President of the Republic, so that those responsible for these events receive the full weight of the law, requesting his support to combat these acts of violence, which escape the normal regulations... and require the work of all sectors,\" the ANFP said in a statement on Sunday. The governing body will also call an urgent meeting of Chilean football to speed up the work of security in order to toughen the penalties and punishments for violence in stadiums. The lack of control by police and clubs has turned stadiums into hostile territory and has become one of the biggest problems in Chilean football. Boric has condemned violence in stadiums before. He addressed the issue in relation to the serious incidents involving Colo Colo and Universidad Catolica supporters at last year's Copa Libertadores matches. \"The clubs have to take charge... or rather end, any kind of link with organisations such as the barras bravas. There will be an intervention in football matters,\" he said at the time.","17":"SANTIAGO, April 28 (Reuters) - While Chile's plan to take control of its lithium industry has caused global shockwaves, state-led production of the metal used to make electric vehicle batteries is seen by analysts as likely years away given technical and political challenges. President Gabriel Boric last week said he would move to gradually nationalize the country's lithium industry, which holds the world's largest reserves of the metal, in a bid to boost Chile's economy. The plan relies on negotiations with lithium producers, public-private partnerships with technology companies, tense negotiations with political rivals, and the creation of a national lithium company, all of which could take years to accomplish, analysts said. Chile's divided Congress, for example, has already stonewalled much of Boric's progressive agenda, and the government would need support from opposition parties. \"We need projects to be developed as soon as possible if we want Chile to benefit from this (lithium) boom,\" said Daniela Desormeaux, director of Chile's Center for Copper Studies (Cesco), adding that creating the national lithium company is \"the most complicated\" element of the plan since it requires legislative support. Economy Minister Nicolas Grau told Reuters earlier in the week that the government wanted to start negotiations with current producers by mid-year and have an agreement before the end of Boric's term in 2026. Full cooperation from existing lithium producers Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) and SQM (SQMA.SN) is unlikely, with Albemarle already signaling it will keep its contract unchanged until it expires 2043. \"The contract itself is not going to change,\" Albemarle's Chile Manager Ignacio Mehech told reporters after a meeting with Corfo, Chile's state development office that it currently holds its lithium contract with. \"State participation, according to what Corfo told us, will be discussed later when the contract is about to expire and therefore from now until 2043 our counterpart will continue to be Corfo.\" SQM on Wednesday signaled that it was ready to start talks with the government soon. Furthermore, new requirements for unproven extraction techniques and long environmental regulatory review times could \"act as a brake on the development of lithium projects at a time when the lithium 'moment' is widely seen as right now,\" said Nicholas Watson, from consultancy Teneo. \"Even if the entity is authorized, it will take time to establish it as a fully resourced and viable outfit that can partner effectively with private firms,\" said Watson, referring to a state lithium company. Chile's state-run Codelco, the largest copper producer in the world, plays a key role in Boric's lithium plan although it has no experience in producing the white metal. Despite some concerns that lithium production could distract Codelco from its core copper focus, Grau said the government has \"faith in Codelco's abilities.\" He did not rule out Codelco being the operator in future public-private partnerships. Getting a cohesive plan together soon matters could become more political as the country faces presidential elections in two years. \"If negotiations drag out, the 2025 electoral cycle will begin to play a larger role as some candidates could offer a different vision for the country's lithium,\" according to a report from the Eurasia consultancy. Chile was the world's largest lithium producer until Australia overtook it in 2017. A JPMorgan report noted that Argentina's burgeoning lithium industry, which has tended to embrace private producers, could overtake Chile in 2028. \"For now, it remains uncertain whether Chile will be able to organize its lithium industry towards considerable growth in terms of production and industry value,\" said Johann Tan, a commodities analyst at Fitch Solutions. Despite Chile's leading role in global lithium production, \"the effort to assert state control over strategic projects\" could enhance the role of Australia and Argentina \"which have demonstrated greater regulatory certainty and fewer risks of resource nationalism,\" the Eurasia report read. The report noted that Argentina currently has more lithium projects in the pipeline than any other country in the world. SQM and Albemarle, the only two companies that currently extract lithium in Chile, both held preliminary meetings with the country's state development office this week to discuss the government's plan. SQM said it would need an additional $2 billion to meet its environmental sustainability goals, which it said also align with the government's lithium strategy. Albemarle has said it needs new water sources to expand in Chile's Atacama salt flat, noting a desalination project was awaiting permits and construction. The government is seeking a controlling stake in all public-private partnerships in the Atacama salt flat, but when asked if private companies will be in charge of decision making or if the state will have the final say, the economy minister said it would depend on negotiations. \"In the Atacama salt flat, the answers to those questions will be answered little by little as negotiations progress,\" Grau said. Outside the Atacama, the government said it would take a controlling stake in \"strategic\" salt flats, but has yet to define that also. When asked which salt flats are strategic, Grau said \"there still isn't enough information, but of course that will exist when private companies participate.\" Several companies have already begun exploration in Chile's Maricunga salt flat south of the Atacama. Grau added that \"it's reasonable to leave space\" for how the specifics of each public-private partnership will work depending on the value of each project. \"Maybe Albemarle or SQM can negotiate a shareholders agreement that could work,\" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of Plusmining consulting in Santiago, but added he finds it hard to imagine that smaller companies would want to provide capital for projects on which the state makes the final decisions.","18":"LIMA, April 27 (Reuters) - Peru's economy minister on Thursday said \"conditions were being established\" to develop lithium mining projects in the country, a week after Chile launched a plan to boost state control of the industry. \"A window of opportunity has opened and we want to take advantage of it,\" said Economy Minister Alex Contreras, saying that there was \"a lot of interest\" in speeding up development in Peru as decisions in other countries were spooking investors. Contreras declined to give further detail on what projects were being developed in Peru. The world's second largest copper producer, Peru currently has a lithium exploration project in the region of Puno, on the border with Bolivia, run by Macusani Yellowcake, a subsidiary of Canada's American Lithium Corp (LI.V). Nearby Chile, Argentina and Bolivia form the so-called \"lithium triangle,\" which is believed to contain more than half the world's resources across its extensive salt flats. Prices for the metal - key for powering electric vehicles - have however dipped from last year's records amid high output and weaker Chinese demand. Chile's move follows a sweeping lithium nationalization plan enacted by Mexico last year, while Bolivia's ruling socialists have also favored state control, though it is counting on Chinese partners to unlock its huge but untapped reserves. \"There are investors interested, not only in lithium but in different economic sectors,\" said Contreras, saying other industries could benefit from potential investment in lithium battery plants. New mining operations should be key to growing the nation's economy by an average of 3% annually over the coming years, he added. Peru's government has trimmed down its economic growth forecast to 2.5% for this year. Peru's mining sector has been hit by extended nationwide protests following the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo in December last year. Contreras predicted a fiscal deficit of 2.1% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) this year, adding that private investment in the country was expected to fall in 2023 for a second year in a row.","19":"MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric's pitch last week to enshrine greater state control over lithium is emerging as the latest test for the resource nationalism embraced by Latin America's ascendant left but which has proven tough to implement in practice. While the former student protest leader's proposal to give the government a majority stake in all future lithium projects faces an uncertain path in Congress, its mere introduction shook one of the mining industry's most lucrative corners. The push from Boric, 37, also highlights the long-running regional tension between governments' hunger for control of coveted commodities and future profits versus their ongoing need for private sector capital and know-how. \"In Chile, its probably going to be the most significant case,\" said Carlos Pascual, top energy executive with IHS Markit, referring to other regional efforts to exert more government control over the mineral seen as key to a greener future and citing Chile's outsize role in the global metals market as the world's top producer of copper and No. 2 in lithium. \"This is seen as an opportunity to ensure direct revenues to the state just as many countries decided to make the decision to nationalize oil in a different era,\" he added. Last year, Boric's fellow leftist in Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, enacted a sweeping lithium nationalization and later ordered the creation of a new state-run lithium company, LitioMx, even though the country is still far from selling its first cargo of the ultra-light metal. Lithium is in high demand for rechargeable batteries for future fleets of electric vehicles in the global transition to green energy. Lopez Obrador, who reveres the country's landmark 1938 oil nationalization, justified his policy as its logical extension. He invoked past abuses at the hands of colonial masters and more recent corporate titans, arguing that only the government can prevent exploitation and ensure broadly-distributed benefits. Across the world, nationalizing oil industries in particular has proved attractive as a means of cashing in on valuable raw materials and boosting development, even as competitive commodity markets often see more output and innovation. Illustrating the challenges of starting from scratch, a Mexican official knowledgeable about government plans for mining, however played down the possibility the new state lithium miner might achieve production anytime soon, instead touting a different option. \"LitioMx could drive the value chain by importing lithium,\" the official told Reuters. Asked for comment, a spokesman for Mexico's energy ministry stressed that LitioMx remains focused on finding and extracting lithium, and while future imports could be considered \"it's too early for that.\" Unsurprisingly, mining companies are less than ecstatic about the statist tilt of Lopez Obrador and Boric, who stressed that under his plan private miners would be able to partner with a not-yet-created state-owned producer, but only as minority stakeholders. \"It's a brave bet to ask an investor to prefer an uncertain marriage with a state company and a minority stake risking capital and technology as opposed to simply flying alone,\" said Armando Ortega, who chairs the executive committee of Baramin, Mexico's biggest producer of barite, a mineral used in oil drilling. Chile and neighbors Bolivia and Argentina are believed to hold more than half of the world's extractable lithium in otherworldly salt flats that typically employ evaporation pools to concentrate the metal, though new technologies are also being developed. The ruling socialists of Bolivia have also insisted that the state take the driver's seat in unlocking its huge but untapped reserves, although it is counting on the help of partners like Chinese battery giant CATL (300750.SZ) to do so. Peru, a mining powerhouse best known for copper, might have pursued a similar approach to Boric to bolster its development of lithium had former President Pedro Castillo not been ousted late last year. The leftist Castillo won a narrow victory in 2021, pledging to nationalize the ultra-light metal along with other minerals including copper, but later moderated his position, leaving the promise unfulfilled. Ivan Merino, who was Castillo's first energy and mining minister, said in an interview on Monday that Peru is for now watching from the sidelines as the resource nationalism trend gains steam. \"It's now almost commonplace,\" he said. \"We will see history made, but without participating in it.\" That leaves the exception to the trend, Argentina, as an increasingly likely Latin American destination for new private capital for lithium. \"That's not because Argentina is doing what needs to be done, but rather because of our neighborhood's upheavals and the world's spiking demand,\" said Santiago Dondo, its former deputy minister for mining. A strong pipeline of lithium projects in Argentina, the world's No. 4 producer, are already close to coming online. Dondo said the four political parties in the main opposition coalition to outgoing leftist President Alberto Fernandez recently voted to endorse private enterprise as the sector's main motor ahead of elections later this year. He noted that local control over mining in three key provinces in northwest Argentina managed to help thwart any moves toward lithium nationalization at the national level a couple years ago, boosting investor sentiment. But Dondo still worries that lithium could be eclipsed by another battery technology. \"We don't know how many years we'll have this huge window of opportunity,\" he said. \"Change in the energy transition is getting faster all the time.\"","20":"SANTIAGO, April 25 (Reuters) - Chile's state development office Corfo said on Tuesday it met with U.S.-based miner Albemarle (ALB.N) to discuss the South American country's plan to nationalize the lithium industry. Chile's leftist President Gabriel Boric last week announced that control of the country's vast lithium operations would over time be transferred from Albemarle and SQM (SQMA.SN) to a separate state-owned company. The move shocked investors and foreign companies and raised concerns about the production and supply of lithium, a metal essential in electric vehicle batteries. Chile has the world's largest lithium reserves. Albemarle's Chile manager, Ignacio Mehech, and Corfo Vice President Jose Miguel Benavente discussed the government's plan, which focuses primarily on the Atacama salt flat where Albemarle has a contract to operate until 2043, Corfo said in a statement. Corfo will continue owning mining properties, while mining would be carried out by lease contracts that \"gradually incorporate the state\" through public-private alliances with a state majority, the statement said. Benavente said the \"public-private association and a possible extension beyond 2043\" would be defined at a later date, but added that the agreement should benefit both parties. In a separate statement released after the meeting, Mehech said Boric's statement about respecting contracts is an \"unequivocal sign to the market that lets us maximize our commitment in Chile.\" He added that Albemarle, the world's largest producer of lithium, wants to grow in Chile and in the Atacama salt flat with new technologies. \"The new era of lithium is in total sync with the lithium strategy the government has outlined,\" Mehech said, adding that the company is looking to advance its direct lithium extraction technology, which is a key element of the government's plan. Economy Minister Nicolas Grau told Reuters on Monday that the government will start official talks with both lithium operators through state-miner Codelco by the middle of this year and hopes to have an agreement before the end of Boric's term in 2026. On Monday, SQM CEO Ricardo Ramos also met with Corfo and said the Chilean lithium company, the world's second-largest producer of the metal, would require $2 billion to enact the government's plans. SQM's contract expires in 2023.","21":"SANTIAGO, April 25 (Reuters) - After their pick-up truck was stolen at gunpoint outside their home in Santiago last June, Javiera Castillo and her partner began learning how to shoot a pistol to prevent future encounters. Castillo, 23, a student and small-business owner who lives in the middle-class neighborhood of Maipu in Santiago, is one of a record number of Chileans worried about growing violence in the country. \"There are lots of robberies where we live and with crime the way it is today, it's almost a necessity to have a gun in the house,\" Castillo told Reuters from a shooting range in the Chilean capital, adding the attack last year had left her terrified of leaving the house at night. \"As we've been taking classes and training, improving our aim, we're losing some of that fear.\" Chile remains one of the safest countries in Latin America. While violent crime reports have increased in recent years, officials caution that this sharp uptick is likely due to a resumption of public life after the pandemic lockdowns. According to government data, homicides rose nearly a third in 2022, one of the highest yearly increases in the region, while violent robberies increased 63%. Kidnappings rose to 46, the highest number on record, according to the police, who detained 76 people in connection with the cases, most of whom were identified as foreigners. Authorities say an influx of guns and organized crime have contributed to the numbers. That has hurt progressive President Gabriel Boric, with many voters disapproving of his handling of crime. A March IPSOS poll of 29 countries shows Chileans tied with South Africans as the most worried about crime, beating respondents in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. This has led to more demand for armored cars and security guards among businesses and wealthy individuals, while the number of new gun registrations has trended upward since 2009, according to the most recent report by the ministry of defense. The ministry told Reuters new gun registrations specifically for personal defense have risen 6% in the last six months. \"It's their lives or ours,\" Hernando Guerrero, Castillo's partner, said. Rodrigo Rivera, manager of Blindatek, a vehicle bulletproofing service, says he started armoring cars three years ago in response to requests from clients of his car accessories company. Rivera says the company has armored 200 vehicles since. His initial clients included companies and executives, but the cars are also now hired by workers who travel at night or families who have been carjacked at gunpoint. \"In the region, Chile was probably the only country that did not have armored vehicles established,\" Rivera told Reuters. \"This is a business that will continue to grow, it's hard for violence to go down. Like in other countries, this industry comes and stays.\" Shopping centers in Chile increased security spending by 30% in 2022, according to the Chilean Chamber of Shopping Centers, while police data show that the number of new or renewed security guard registrations is set to hit 200,000 this year from around 145,000 in 2022. \"The industry is growing, molding and adjusting,\" said Lieutenant-Colonel Miguel Calderon, subprefect of the police division in charge of licensing private security. Calderon added that population growth and increased economic activity also contributed to growth in private security. The data showed that new companies in charge of training security guards or for security monitoring services in 2023 have already surpassed totals for the previous five years. Manuel Guerra, a former prosecutor who previously headed public ministry offices in northern Chile and Santiago, said the amount of solved homicides has dropped compared to previous years. \"This shows that people are more afraid of collaborating,\" Guerra said, adding the state has been slow to respond and that many of the homicides are between organized crime groups. In the last few years, data from the ministry of the interior shows a jump in the use of firearms in homicides. Alvaro Hofflinger, an assistant professor at the Universidad de la Frontera who studies public policy and inequality, said that research shows an increasing number of people arming themselves will not reduce violence. \"In this scenario, where there is more tolerance for the use of weapons and legitimacy of self-defense, my concern is the formation of self-defense groups that use violence against certain groups like migrants or Indigenous people.\" He added political parties could use the rise in violence as a strategy to employ an \"iron fist\" instead reducing income inequality. The government did not respond to several inquiries from Reuters, though Deputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve said the government needed “strong institutions” to fight organized crime. After a third police officer was killed on duty in less than a month, President Boric signed new laws and allotted an extra $1.5 billion to fight crime. \"Having to deal with a security crisis and tackling migration are especially difficult areas for a government with progressive credentials,\" said Nicholas Watson of consultancy Teneo.","22":"LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - Chile's move to nationalise its lithium industry adds fresh supply chain uncertainty for global carmakers facing a shortage of electric vehicle (EV) battery materials and could provide fresh urgency to find new sources of the metal. Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced plans last Thursday to create a new state-owned company to control its lithium industry. The country has the world's largest reserves of the metal and accounts for 30% of global output. While there are startups working on sodium ion batteries that could eventually provide a cheaper alternative for EVs, for many years to come the auto industry will be entirely dependent on lithium for its batteries. Leading industry executives have warned of a supply chain crunch around the middle of the decade as the world's top automakers plan to spend nearly $1.2 trillion through 2030 to develop and produce millions of electric vehicles. \"Automakers may be more trepidatious around committing to lithium supply deals from Chile until it's clear what nationalisation will look like,\" said Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. \"Most automakers will have been looking for a diversified portfolio of regional supply before this anyway, but perhaps this makes other regions more appealing.\" David Brocas, founder of mineral supply chain advisory firm Voltaire Minerals, said that battery metals are becoming as strategically important to countries as oil, and carmakers will need a special \"diversified sourcing strategy\" in response. Major carmakers have already been looking for new lithium supplies in the United States, Europe and Africa. General Motors (GM.N), for instance, invested in Lithium Americas Corp (LAC.TO) in January and will help it to develop Nevada's Thacker Pass lithium mining project. This push for fresh options is expected to accelerate. \"We're implementing a commodity roadmap that includes regional diversification,\" a Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) spokeswoman said in an email. \"So we're looking at a lot of regions.\" Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer told reporters on Monday that the carmaker is \"still open to direct purchasing from Chile - but there are alternatives, such as Australia and Canada.\" Shares in lithium miners in Australia, the largest producer making up around half of global supply, rose after Chile's announcement. Chile's move to nationalise its lithium industry follows a trend of countries seeking tighter control over key resources. Mexico has nationalised its lithium industry, while Zimbabwe, Myanmar and Indonesia have all announced restrictions affecting various commodities. Santiago's announcement \"will place an even higher focus on secure supplies of UK and European lithium for carmakers who are desperate to secure raw materials for EVs,\" Jeremy Wrathall, CEO of Cornish Lithium, wrote in an email. \"No lithium = no batteries = no EVs.\" Lithium is not the first supply chain crisis facing the car industry, which found itself short of semiconductors during the COVID-19 pandemic and is unlikely to be the last. Rob Anstey, CEO at GDI, which is developing silicon anodes for batteries, said this should be a wake-up call for an auto industry dependent on China for graphite for battery electrodes. \"If Chile nationalises lithium, Australia can increase supply and America and Europe will increase supply,\" Anstey said. \"But if China starts to restrict exports of graphite, the entire battery global supply chain screeches to a halt.\" Several startups are developing EV batteries with silicon-based electrodes that hold more energy, have greater range and charge more quickly, but at present 70% of all graphite comes from China. Chile's move may provide an advantage for other countries hopeful of developing their own lithium supplies. Lithium exploration company Aterian (ATN.L) sees opportunities for mining in a number of African countries, including Morocco and Rwanda. \"These countries will attract the energy transition investment which would have previously gone to Chile,\" said Executive Chairman Charles Bray.","23":"SANTIAGO, April 24 (Reuters) - Chile will start talks with SQM (SQMA.SN) over its operations in the Atacama “this semester” to convince the world's No. 2 lithium mining company to sign onto a state-led public-private model, the economy minister said on Monday, while SQM said it would need to invest an additional $2 billion under the new strategy. In his first interview with international media since the government last week announced plans for state control of the metal key for electric vehicle batteries, Economy Minister Nicolas Grau told Reuters state miner Codelco would start talks over public-private lithium production \"as soon as possible.\" While Codelco dominates copper output in Chile, the world's top copper producer, the state has yet to produce lithium. \"Codelco's conversations with the companies that operate in the Salar de Atacama, particularly with SQM, which ends its contract in 2030, is something that will begin immediately during this semester,\" Grau said. In a statement later on Monday, SQM said they met with Chile's state development office Corfo to discuss the lithium strategy and said the company would need to invest $2 billion of additional capital to achieve the plan's sustainable goals. Grau added that progress was also expected with U.S.-based Albemarle Corp (ALB.N), the world's top lithium producer, whose contract expires in 2043. Albemarle and Santiago-based SQM are the only two lithium producers in Chile and operate in the Atacama salt flat, which has 90% of the Andean country's lithium reserves. Stocks for both companies plummeted on Friday following President Gabriel Boric's nationalization announcement. At closing on Monday, SQM's stock had recovered 6.1% while Albemarle had bounced back 5.9%. When asked about the minister's statements, Albemarle said they had no new comments and referred to their previous statement that the plan would have \"no material impact on our business.\" \"Regarding the conversations related to the Salar de Atacama, I want to be very clear on this, it is something that is going to be defined during this government,\" Grau said, adding that there are no concrete deadlines, but all actors are aware of the urgency involved. The next national election is scheduled for 2025. The strategy includes a new national lithium company, which congress must approve, but Grau said the government believes Codelco has the \"capacity to assume new challenges\" as well as the \"scale and know-how\" to deal with lithium. Grau added that Codelco can start moving forward with establishing public-private partnerships with companies that have advanced explorations in the Maricunga salt flat. For other salt flats, Grau said the agreements will depend on the development timelines, productive and strategic value of each project. \"It is reasonable to leave some space so that the concrete public-private structuring of each salt flat depends on the interest of each one,\" Grau said, adding that Boric noted that the government \"control will be reserved for salt flats considered to be strategic. Chile, which holds the world's largest lithium reserves and is the second-largest producer globally after Australia, mainly produces the white metal from salt lakes, rather than from hard rock mines. Grau added that the government will start hosting talks with local and Indigenous communities in the Atacama salt flat early on. Some communities have had strong opposition to lithium projects, but the government has said it would raise production while caring for ecosystems. The minister said that most of the steps to implement the new lithium strategy will be implemented this year, but the creation of a new national lithium company can take longer.","24":"SANTIAGO, April 24 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric's plan to nationalize his country's immense lithium industry is putting the spotlight on an emerging crop of filtration technologies aimed at revolutionizing how the metal is produced for the electric vehicle industry. In a national prime time address, Boric said last Thursday a new state-owned company would work to slash the environmental impacts of lithium production by shifting away from evaporation ponds, traditionally used to remove the metal from brine, in favor of direct lithium extraction (DLE). While neighboring Bolivia, as well as General Motors Co(GM.N), Rio Tinto Ltd(RIO.AX) and other companies, have made their own DLE bets, Boric's move represents the biggest vote of confidence to date in the commercially unproven suite of technologies given plans to deploy it across Chile's vast lithium reserves, the world's largest. \"This is the best chance we have at transitioning to a sustainable and developed economy,\" said Boric, a leftist 37-year-old elected in late 2021. DLE technologies are designed to extract the metal from salty brines in Chile's Atacama Desert and elsewhere in the world using filters, membranes, ceramic beads or other equipment that can typically be housed in a small warehouse. While multiple companies are working to develop competing versions, the broad promise of DLE is a boost to global lithium production with a footprint far smaller than open-pit mines and evaporation ponds often are the size of multiple football fields and unpopular with local communities. Many DLE technologies use lots of potable water and electricity. None have yet to work independently at commercial scale. If Chile could help one or more DLE technology succeed, it would cement the country's dominant role in the global lithium and EV industries for decades to come. \"The devil is in the details, but it's a great opportunity for technological innovation of brine processing, either way,\" Chris Berry, an independent lithium industry consultant, said of Boric's plan. SQM (SQMA.SN) and Albemarle Corp (ALB.N), Chile's two existing lithium producers, use evaporation ponds to produce the metal. Both are studying DLE, though neither have deployed it. Livent Corp (LTHM.N) uses a variation of DLE technology in Argentina alongside evaporation ponds. \"Now that regulatory bodies are forcing the issue, it's only going to speed up the innovation and commercialization,\" said Teague Egan, CEO of privately held EnergyX, which is building a DLE test facility in northern Chile and has a development project with GM. The goal for Boric and the DLE industry is to extract lithium from brine and reinject what is left back underground, in a closed loop process that does not affect water tables. \"Boric recognizes you can't just evaporate all the water and wreck the geological structures,\" said John Burba, who helped pioneer one DLE technology in the 1970s and is now CEO of International Battery Metals Ltd (IBAT.CD), which builds portable DLE plants. Lake Resources NL (LKE.AX), Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd (VUL.AX), Renault SA, (RENA.PA) Stellantis NV (STLAM.MI) are also supporting DLE projects. Lake Resources is working with Bill Gates-backed Lilac Solutions Inc to deploy Lilac's DLE technology in Argentina. Lilac also plans to install a DLE test facility in Chile in coming weeks, said CEO Dave Snydacker. \"DLE is a great way for Chile to expand production in an environmentally friendly and scalable way,\" said Snydacker. Several prominent short sellers in recent years have alleged that DLE technologies from Lilac and Standard Lithium Ltd (SLI.V) do not work, charges the companies have strongly denied. In Chile, DLE companies see a business opportunity despite the nationalization plans given that Boric's new state lithium company is expected to need technical support. \"Nationalization or not, they'll require technology,\" said Amanda Sanregret of privately held Summit Nanotech Corp, which earlier this month opened a Santiago office and DLE test facility.","25":"SINGAPORE, April 21 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric said on Thursday he would nationalise the country's lithium industry and create a state-owned company to produce the metal that is a key component of electric vehicle batteries. Boric said future lithium contracts would only be issued as public-private partnerships with state control. Chile holds the world's largest lithium reserves and is the world's second-largest producer. Following are key details on the global lithium industry.\nPRODUCTION Lithium is currently produced from hard rock or brine mines. Australia is the world's biggest supplier, with production from hard rock mines. Argentina, Chile and China mainly produce it from salt lakes. World output was 737,000 tonnes of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) in 2022 and is estimated to reach 964,000 tonnes in 2023 and 1,167,000 tonnes in 2024, according to the Resources and Energy Quarterly Report by the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Resources in March. Rapid growth is forecast to be met by output gains in Australia, Chile and Argentina. Greenbushes, Western Australia, by Talison Lithium (a joint venture of Tianqi Lithium (002466.SZ), IGO (IGO.AX) and Albemarle Corp (ALB.N)). Current production capacity at 1.34 million tonnes a year of chemical-grade and technical-grade lithium concentrate. Pilgangoora, Western Australia, owned by Pilbara Minerals (PLS.AX), produces 360,000 to 380,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate per annum, with two expansions underway that will increase production capacity to one million tonnes per annum. Mt Cattlin, Western Australia, owned by Allkem (AKE.AX), the company formed from the merger of Orocobre and Galaxy Resources, produced 194,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in 2022. Mibra, Minas Gerais, Brazil, owned by Advanced Metallurgical Group (AMG.AS), produces 90,000 tonnes of spodumene a year, with plans to expand to 130,000 tonnes by the end of Q2 2023. Mount Marion, Western Australia, owned by Mineral Resources Ltd (MIN.AX), was on track to produce 450,000 to 600,000 tonnes of spodumene as of August 2022, with a targeted expansion to 900,000 tonnes per annum delayed until July 2023. Salar de Atacama, Antofagasta, Chile, owned by Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM) (SQMA.SN), produces 180,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year, and expects that to rise to 210,000 by 2024. Pozuelos-Pastos Grandes lithium salt lake, Argentina, bought by Ganfeng Lithium (002460.SZ), will produce 30,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate starting 2024, and can potentially be expanded to 50,000 tonnes.","26":"SANTIAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - Chile has moved to boost state control over its lithium industry as it seeks to diversify from mining into batteries and other areas, spooking investors in the country's dominant miners of the white metal, SQM (SQMA.SN) and Albemarle Corp (ALB.N). Chile's progressive President Gabriel Boric late on Thursday announced the move that would see the world's second largest lithium producer shift to a model with the state holding a controlling interest in all projects through a public company that would partner with private mining firms. By late Friday trading, Chilean firm SQM's U.S.-listed shares tumbled some 18%, while Albemarle was down nearly 9%. SQM's lithium contract in Chile is set to expire in 2030 and Albemarle's in 2043, giving it more insulation from the potential move. The bid for state control in Chile, which has the world's largest reserves of the battery metal, reflects a wider wave of resource nationalism around Latin America, home to the so-called \"lithium triangle\", which holds the world's largest trove of the metal essential for electric vehicle batteries. It poses a fresh challenge to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers scrambling to secure battery materials. Mexico nationalized its lithium deposits last year, and Indonesia banned exports of nickel ore, a key battery material, in 2020. Boric said in his announcement that Chile would not cancel existing contracts, though it would try to negotiate with mining firms to voluntarily shift to a public-private model. But he signaled the country's ambitions to participate in the higher margin industries surrounding battery production rather than being restricted to mining, a common lament of emerging markets with big deposits of the metal. Speaking from the northern city of Antofagasta on Friday afternoon, Boric, 37, said the government has ambitions to produce value added products and batteries. \"In Chile we can add value, we can produce batteries, here in our country, we just don't have to extract the raw material,\" Boric said, adding that the government was opening a technological institute of lithium and salt flats in the northern city. Separately, Chilean economic development CORFO said Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) plans to build a $290 million lithium cathode factory in Chile's northern Antofagasta region. SQM has a larger footprint in Chile, with 81,000 hectares (about 200,000 acres) for lithium extraction compared with Albemarle's 16,000 hectares. In a statement, SQM it was \"analyzing the strategy delivered by the government.\" Albemarle said it would have \"no material impact on our business\" and that it would continue talks on investing in further growth and using new technologies in Chile. The economy ministry pushed back against describing the planned move as a nationalization of the industry but acknowledged the state would have a controlling stake in every public-private venture looking to extract lithium. \"It's not valid to talk about a process of nationalization because the announced strategy doesn't alter the standing of legal valid legal property,\" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters, adding that the current law gives state ownership over lithium already. \"When it comes to the Atacama salt flats, the president clearly said in his speech that Chile will respect what's been established in existing contracts.\" In neighboring countries in the lithium triangle, which spans Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, governments are increasingly pushing for a greater public sector stake in mining of the metal. Such resource nationalism, long a hallmark of Latin America's oil sector, has a poor record, according to Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at The Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. He said historically, mining in Latin America has mostly failed to bring about steady growth, and caused untold environmental damage, which has frequently led governments to take over for private companies. “Today’s lithium boom offers an opportunity to learn from past mistakes,” Gedan said, calling it “a difficult balancing act.” Giving a big role to the state without excluding private investors is a “savvy middle ground,” he said. Argentine state energy firm YPF last year began exploring lithium, while Bolivia has long maintained strict control over its huge though largely untapped resources. It recently gave out a lithium tender to a Chinese consortium including battery giant CATL. Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Bolivia's Luis Arce have touted the idea of a regional lithium \"OPEC\" to coordinate on lithium policy and benefit local economies.","27":"SANTIAGO, April 20 (Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric said on Thursday he would nationalize the country's lithium industry, the world's second largest producer of the metal essential in electric vehicle batteries, to boost its economy and protect its environment. The shock move in the country with the world's largest lithium reserves would in time transfer control of Chile's vast lithium operations from industry giants SQM (SQMA.SN) and Albemarle (ALB.N) to a separate state-owned company. It poses a fresh challenge to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers scrambling to secure battery materials, as more countries look to protect their natural resources. Mexico nationalized its lithium deposits last year, and Indonesia banned exports of nickel ore, a key battery material, in 2020. \"This is the best chance we have at transitioning to a sustainable and developed economy. We can't afford to waste it,\" Boric said in an address televised nationwide. Future lithium contracts would only be issued as public-private partnerships with state control, he said. The government would not terminate current contracts, but hoped companies would be open to state participation before they expire, he said, without naming Albemarle and SQM, the world's No.1 and No.2 lithium producers respectively. SQM's contract is set to expire in 2030 and Albemarle's in 2043. SQM, formally called Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile, and Albemarle supply Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), LG Energy Solution Ltd (373220.KS) and other EV and battery manufacturers. Albemarle said the announcement would have \"no material impact on our business\" and it would continue talks on investing in further growth and using new technologies in Chile. SQM was not immediately available for comment. South Korean battery maker SK On, which has a long-term supply contract with SQM, said it would monitor the development and respond with a long term view. The announcement by Chile did not trigger a reversal in lithium prices , which have plunged more than 70% from a November peak due to weakening EV demand in China, the world's biggest auto market. The most-traded lithium carbonate futures on the Wuxi Stainless Steel Exchange in China fell 3.4% as of 0618 GMT on Friday. \"When or if battery makers renew their contracts with lithium firms in Chile, contract conditions would likely become more difficult than what they saw in the past when there was no state involvement,\" said Cho Hyunryul, an analyst at Samsung Securities. The move is likely to spur a shift in future investment in lithium to other countries including Australia, the world's biggest producer, analysts said. \"Policy stability is very important for any mining project ... Mining-friendly jurisdictions like Australia would be places where incremental funds get invested,\" said Harsh Bardia, an analyst at National Australia Bank's private wealth arm JBWere. Boric said state-owned Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, will be tasked to find the best way forward for a state-owned lithium company and he would seek approval from Congress for the plan in the second half of the year. Congress has been a check on many of Boric's more ambitious proposals and shelved a proposed tax reform bill in early March. Codelco and state miner Enami will be given exploration and extraction contracts in areas where there are now private projects before the national lithium company is formed. A division will be dedicated to advancing technology to minimize environmental impacts, including favoring direct lithium extraction over evaporation ponds. Privately held Summit Nanotech Corp, which is developing direct lithium extraction technology, welcomed the announcement. Boric said the country would look to protect biodiversity and share mining benefits with indigenous and surrounding communities. \"Today we present a national lithium strategy that's technically solid and ambitious,\" the president said, adding it would build \"a Chile that distributes wealth we all generate in a more just way\".","28":"SANTIAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - Chile's state-owned Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, on Friday said a demonstration against insecurity and crime in the neighbouring mining city of Calama has blocked access to its large deposits in that northern part of the country. \"Codelco informs that since approximately 4:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) this morning, the accesses to the Chuquicamata, Radomiro Tomic, Gabriela Mistral and Ministro Hales divisions have been blocked,\" the state-owned company said in a statement. After midnight, the northern Chilean city began a strike to protest crime violence, in the midst of a worsening public security crisis in the country that is hitting the northern regions bordering Peru and Bolivia the hardest. \"We are a company in the municipality of Calama and our workers are part of this community, so we understand the unease and concern of the citizens about crime, of which we have also been victims as an organisation,\" he added in his statement. Codelco said, however, that the blockades \"put infrastructure and critical equipment at risk, which could affect the future development of our operations\" as it affects both workers who have finished their shifts and those who are due to start their shifts. The strike was called by Calama's own mayor, Eliecer Chamorro, after several violent incidents earlier this week, including an armed attack on a police office, left two dead and five injured. According to Carabineros police, incendiary barricades, protesters and detained trucks blocked other routes as well, towards the airport and in the direction of the coastal city of Antofagasta, a major urban centre in northern Chile.","29":"April 21 (Reuters) - Chile, the world's second largest lithium producer, said it plans to transfer control of the production of the mineral essential for electric vehicle (EV) batteries to a new state-owned company. Here are key facts about lithium and EVs: The silvery-white element is the lightest metal and highly reactive, giving it strong energy storage potential per unit of weight. This makes the alkali metal the mainstream choice for EV batteries, where high energy density is key to enabling long distances between charging. Australia is the world's largest lithium producer, but Chile has by far the largest known reserves. Other countries with major deposits are Argentina, China and the United States. Lithium is abundant, but it takes substantial funding to extract it from ore or brine. The price has seen boom-bust cycles in recent years as producers have ramped up production to benefit from rising prices, but then created a glut. Strong output and weak demand for EVs in China has depressed prices in recent months. Battery grade lithium prices touched record levels of $85,000 a tonne in December, but have slumped by nearly 50% since then. That price is still relatively high, around double the price in October 2021. A range of batteries that need less or no lithium have been under development and the most advanced is the sodium-ion battery, which China's CATL (300750.SZ) plans to begin producing this year. The materials to make sodium-ion batteries are much cheaper, but the batteries have a lower energy storage capacity, meaning more frequent charging, and break down faster than lithium-ion batteries. Another alternative battery replaces lithium with magnesium, but those are still in the research phase. While alternatives may take hold in the long-term, the efficiency and proven technology of batteries using lithium mean that in the short to medium term, lithium will remain a key material for EV batteries, analysts say. EV battery makers have developed multiple types of lithium battery products. A battery is charged and discharged by lithium ions moving between the negative anode and the positive cathode electrodes. Other key metals used in EV batteries are cobalt, nickel phosphate and manganese. EVs are a key part of the plan to meet zero carbon goals to curb climate change, so lithium demand has been rising. A lithium-ion EV battery pack on average contains about 8 kg of lithium and about 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to meet net zero goals, according to the International Energy Agency. Lithium demand is expected to balloon to 3 million tonnes a year by 2030 from only 300,000 tonnes in 2020, according to Bank of America analysts.","30":"April 21 (Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric announced on Thursday he would nationalise the country's vast lithium industry to boost the economy and protect the environment. The shock announcement is the latest in a trend as countries look to assert greater control over key resources amid intensifying competition for materials that are crucial to the energy transition. Recent moves by governments globally to take more control of their natural resources: * Home to the world's largest lithium reserves, Chile said it will over time transfer control of its vast lithium operations from industry giants SQM (SQMA.SN) and Albemarle (ALB.N) to a separate state-owned company. Chile is the world's second largest producer of lithium, a key component in batteries used in electric vehicles. Last July, Chile's finance minister introduced a tax reform bill that increases copper mining royalties on companies that produce more than 50,000 tonnes a year and raises taxes on high-income earners, increasing state participation in mining income. In January, a Chilean congressional committee approved the mining royalty bill, putting it a step closer to final approval, despite having drawn strong criticism from industry. * In April, Myanmar's ethnic minority Wa militia said it will suspend all work at mines in areas it controls from August, a move that triggered a surge in the price of tin, a material used in electronics and semiconductors. Myanmar accounted for 77% of China's tin ore imports last year, Chinese customs data showed. The Wa-controlled region is estimated to have accounted for over 70% of Myanmar's tin production in 2022, according to the International Tin Association. * A resource powerhouse, Indonesia is tightening controls over various materials in a push to develop local downstream operations and extract greater value. Once one of the world's biggest exporters of nickel, in June 2020 Indonesia banned exports of the metal's ore while it sought to develop a full nickel supply chain, starting from extraction, processing into metals and chemicals used in batteries, all the way to building electric vehicles. Last October, President Joko Widodo said Indonesia was exploring a possible ban on tin exports, and calculations about its potential impact had begun, after the world's top tin exporter had already moved to halt shipments of a number of other metals in order to develop more processing at home. In December, Widodo confirmed an export ban for bauxite starting in June 2023 as scheduled, to encourage domestic processing of a material used as the main ore source of aluminium. More export bans will also be announced in the coming years in order to develop resource processing industry onshore, he said, speaking at an economic forum. * In February, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador signed a decree handing over responsibility for lithium reserves to the energy ministry, after nationalizing lithium deposits in April 2022. * In December 2022, Zimbabwe imposed a ban on the export of unprocessed lithium, in a bid to stop artisanal miners who the government says are digging up and taking the mineral across borders.","31":"SANTIAGO, April 16 (Reuters) - Global copper producers are converging in Chile this week for their largest gathering since 2019, with talks expected to center on the industry's growing M&A wave amid surging demand and tight supply for the metal anchoring the green energy transition. The buyout trend comes as Indigenous groups, host communities and others increasingly oppose the industry's attempts to build new mines, obstacles fueling the growing realization among mining companies that they may need to combine in order to grow. Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) last month offered $22.5 billion to buy smaller rival Teck Resources Ltd (TECKb.TO), an offer that Teck has so far rejected in favor of its own copper-focused growth plans. Lundin Mining Corp (LUN.TO) is paying nearly $1 billion for control of Chile's Caserones copper mine despite ongoing political uncertainty in the country. Leaders from all three companies are slated to be among the roughly 450 investors, executives, analysts and regulators gathering in the Chilean capital of Santiago for the annual World Copper Conference. Registrations are up roughly 8% since 2019 when the conference was last held fully in person. Organizers say they expect the attendance to grow as the week progresses. \"The green transformation theme remains a strong tailwind for copper, the king of green metals,\" Saxo Bank strategist Ole Hansen told Reuters. \"Not least considering how producers face challenges in the years ahead with lower ore grades, rising production costs and lack of investments in recent years.\" Global copper demand expected to reach 53 million tonnes annually by 2053 - more than double current levels - but supply is still expected to fall short, according an S&P Global (SPGI.N) study. That projection in part underscores the deal rush. BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX), the world's largest mining company, last week won shareholder approval for its $6.4 billion takeover of Australian copper producer Oz Minerals Ltd (OZL.AX). Rio Tinto Ltd (RIO.AX), which faces strong opposition to its Resolution Copper project in Arizona, last December paid $3.3 billion to buy rival Turquoise Hill and gain direct control over a giant Mongolian copper mine. And Hudbay Minerals Inc (HBM.TO) last week said it would pay $439 million for rival Copper Mountain Mining Corp (CMMC.TO). Beyond M&A, these mining giants face the creeping problem of attracting new workers, especially in the United States, as well as competition from upstart rivals exploring new ways to extract copper at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and through leaching of mine waste. \"This is a fairly agile market and it is permanently evaluating its long-term investments,\" Chilean Mining Minister Marcela Hernando told Reuters. Hernando, slated to deliver the conference's keynote speech on Tuesday, expects copper output to jump in coming years from her country, the world's top producer, thanks to operations from state-owned Codelco, BHP, Anglo American Plc (AAL.L), Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N), Glencore and Teck. Neighboring Peru, the world's second-largest copper producer, also expects to boost production this year. Copper prices touched a seven-week high last Friday despite macroeconomic concerns fueled by uncertain Chinese demand projections and the ongoing war in Ukraine, although they are down nearly 5% from a seven-month high of $9,550.50 reached in January. \"We expect the copper market to remain in deficit as the green transition accelerates,\" Fitch Solutions said in a recent report to clients. A portion of the weeklong conference is devoted to research presentations on new applications for the red metal, part of an industry plan to go on the offense against aluminum, a cheaper but less-efficient alternative to conduct electricity.","32":"SANTIAGO, April 14 (Reuters) - Lundin Mining Corp's (LUN.TO) bid for control of Chile's Caserones copper mine comes despite ongoing uncertainty over potential policy changes to royalties and taxes, an indication that investors may be regaining confidence in the world no.1 copper-producing country. Lundin last month agreed to pay $950 million for 51% control of the mine, calling the deal \"an endorsement that we believe the mining royalty and taxation discussions are trending in the right direction.\" The deal caused some surprise. In the past 18 months, mining giants have been vocal about concerns in Chile. BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX) said it might reevaluate its investments depending on new tax plans by the government, while Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) has said it would pause expansion plans in Chile, citing political uncertainty. But with the outlook looking rosier for investment and global demand surging for the key green energy metal, reluctance has diminished, experts and officials say. Chile's mining minister, Marcela Hernando, told Reuters on Thursday she felt \"confident\" that the concerns of the industry had been taken into account with the royalty proposals and that she had seen hints investment was starting to improve. \"What one observes are signs, you see how some investments have materialized, how a very important deal was completed a few weeks ago,\" she said, referring to the Caserones purchase. \"We aren't worried investments are going to be scared away.\" A proposed new constitution that, among other changes, would have given the state greater control over mining was rejected by voters last September, while an ambitious tax overhaul plan was voted down by Congress in March. Meanwhile, another government plan for new royalties on mining, currently moving through Congress, has also been tempered amid industry complaints that an increased tax burden at a time when deposits were facing decreased production would hurt the country's competitiveness. \"As the proposed bill has moderated, some companies have gotten to a risk level compatible with their investment decisions, as happened with Lundin,\" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of the Plusmining consulting agency in Santiago. \"Some companies have a more optimistic vision about the final evolution of the royalty bill, which is sparking investment decisions, but there are others that are still in 'wait-and-see' mode.\" Canada-based Teck Resources (TECKb.TO) has also recently boosted investment in Chile, submitting for environmental approval this year a $3 billion project to increase capacity at its Quebrada Blanca 2 mine. But BHP said its stance on investment in Chile had not changed. Freeport did not reply to a request for comment. Lundin said it was considering raising its stake to 70% of the mine for an additional $350 million, but that it would \"continue to evaluate any potential royalty and taxation changes\" as a factor in that decision. Lundin's purchase from JX Nippon Mining & Metals (5020.T) comes at a time when companies are seeing longer delays for permits as opposition has risen from local communities. Some projects have been rejected by the state or by courts on environmental impact concerns. Caserones, located 4,300 meters above sea level, has itself faced strikes by workers and lawsuits by farmers, who have complained about water over-extraction. Chilean courts have since approved plans from JX Nippon to rectify environmental damage and Lundin told Reuters one of the company's \"primary objectives is to minimize potential environmental impacts through implementation of environmental management controls.\" The company added that its nearby Candelaria operation uses desalinated water and has a guaranteed minimum of 80% of renewably-sourced electricity. Lundin remains confident in the future of the Caserones project, which began operations in 2014 and has annual output of 100,000 tonnes of copper. Peter Rockandel, Lundin Mining's CEO, said the firm had \"no concerns\" of what lay ahead in a conference call following the announcement of the deal. The purchase is emblematic of the emerging copper industry trend of buy versus build, said Christopher LaFemina, an equity analyst at Jefferies, with falling share prices and ballooning development costs favoring purchasing, rather than constructing, new mines, even at \"premium prices.\" \"The optimal time to pursue sizable acquisitions is now,\" LaFemina said in a report, adding that the window might close if investors wait for \"the macro environment to improve.\"","33":"SANTIAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - Chile's Congress on Tuesday passed a hard-fought bill to gradually cut the work week to 40 hours from 45 hours, a legislative victory for President Gabriel Boric amid faltering popularity. Boric, who took office last year pledging an ambitious agenda of social and economic reforms, has suffered several setbacks, including voters rejecting a progressive new constitution and legislative defeat for a key tax bill. But the work week law - which now awaits Boric's signature - constitutes a small victory for an administration that has been trying to shift the country away from its free-market constitution. The new law mandates one less hour a week of work per year until the work week reaches 40 hours, bringing Chile in line with most industrialized nations. The bill, which had overwhelming support with 127 votes in favor and just 14 against, comes at a time when countries around the world like Britain and Spain are experimenting with reducing weekly work hours further. Several companies in Chile have already announced that they will adopt the bill, including state-owned copper giant Codelco, which earlier this year said it would seek to implement the 40- -hour work week by 2026. Some smaller firms have criticized the new law, saying they have insufficient resources to hire more workers and replace lost hours. Minister of Labor Jeannette Jara told reporters that the gradual implementation was designed to address this, but \"the main thing is that we have to make progress in rights for workers.\" Design company Organic Style, who introduced the 40-hour week voluntarily during the pandemic, said the change had proven positive. \"It's a very good initiative that has changed our lives,\" owner Danitza Becerra said. (This story has been corrected to say work week cut to 40 hours from 45 hours, not 45 hours from 40 hours, in paragraph 1)","34":"SANTIAGO, April 6 (Reuters) - Chile on Thursday signed new laws and allocated $1.5 billion to fight crime amid skyrocketing perceptions of insecurity and a day after the third police officer in less than a month was killed on duty. \"When it comes to fighting crime and backing Carabineros (police force), there are now fissures in the Chilean state,\" President Gabriel Boric said from La Moneda presidential palace. \"We face organized crime together. Our unity is the most powerful weapon against crime. Boric announced $1.5 billion in added security spending and signed off on four new laws that the government says will help fight organized crime, drug trafficking and crime. The measures include criminalizing extortion as well as increased penalties for kidnapping and some instances of firearm possession. One law increases penalties for crimes against police while giving them more in using force if their lives or lives of others are at-risk. The law has been criticized by human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which issued a press release stating the law could \"increase police abuse and impunity\" and is a \"enormous step back\" in terms of advancing police reforms. Chile's police force has faced human rights abuse accusations following a heavy-handed crackdown of the violent 2019 protests against inequality. Boric, a former student protest leader, was a vocal police critic as a legislator and promised to reform the police as a candidate. Polls show voters largely disapprove of the government's handling of crime and Boric has since hardened his stance. At an earlier press conference, hours after police officer Daniel Palma, 33, was killed on duty in downtown Santiago Wednesday night, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said the government was implementing an intervention plan in 30 districts earlier than scheduled. Palma is the third police officer to be killed on duty in less than a month, sparking public backlash.","35":"March 31 (Reuters) - The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) believes FIFA would be making a mistake to not award the 2030 World Cup to a joint bid from Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile, the regional governing body said at its 76th Congress on Friday. With the slogan \"Juntos\" (together) and the promise of a \"Centenary Cup\", CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez called on FIFA to award the World Cup to the continent where it began. \"Let's not make the mistake that the Olympic Games made of not giving Athens the 1996 venue. We have to have the Centenary World Cup here, to honour history,\" he said. \"(FIFA President Gianni) Infantino I want to appeal to you to find a way to celebrate 100 years of the World Cup in South America. It's not the 2030 Cup, it's the Centenary Cup,\" Dominguez added. The joint bid of the South American countries aims to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the World Cup after the first tournament was held in Uruguay in 1930. Morocco announced earlier this month that it will join Spain and Portugal in three-way bid to stage the 2030 World Cup. FIFA evaluates the bids and makes a shortlist of candidates before the hosts are chosen in a members' vote at its Congress. FIFA said the vote will likely be in September 2024.","36":"March 24 (Reuters) - A dual Haitian-Chilean citizen pleaded guilty in a U.S. court on Friday to three charges involving his role in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise, gunned down in his home in 2021. According to court documents, Rodolphe Jaar is one of 11 defendants in the case, which includes businessmen accused of helping obtain vehicles and firearms from Florida and former Colombian soldiers accused of killing Moise in his bedroom. According to a plea statement Jaar signed on Friday, he provided personnel and funds to kidnap Moise, but the initial plan later turned into a murder plot. Some of the funds were used to buy weapons and pay bribes to the some of the president's security detail, the statement said. Jaar met with the co-conspirators the night before the assassination, according to the statement, at which time Haitian-American James Solages stated the aim was to kill Moise. The court document added that Jaar also met other defendants, including former Haitian Senator Joseph Joel John, Haitian-American Joseph Vincent, Colombian ex-military officer German Rivera and Antonio Intriago, the Venezuelan owner of a Miami-based private security firm. Jaar has also been accused of helping a group of Colombians implicated in the case to hide from Haitian authorities, according to U.S. Department of Justice statement following his arrest last year. Jaar was detained in the neighboring Dominican Republic in early 2022. Sentencing for Jaar, who faces up to life in prison, is set for June 2 in Miami, court filings showed. Jaar's lawyer declined to comment. Moise's murder left a gaping political vacuum in the Caribbean nation and emboldened powerful gangs. The gangs now control large parts of the country as a humanitarian crisis with at least 160,000 people recently displaced plays out, amid calls to send foreign forces to boost out-gunned local police.","37":"SANTIAGO, March 17 (Reuters) - Chile has agreed to an earthquake insurance program with the World Bank protecting it from $630 million worth of damage from strong earthquakes, in an effort to shore up risks to public debt from possible natural disasters. The insurance will cost 4.75% of the total value of the insurance each year, the finance ministry said in a statement. The South American nation is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an area characterized by frequent earthquakes and active volcanoes. The southern Chilean city of Valdivia was struck in 1960 by a 9.5 magnitude earthquake, the most intense on record, which caused over 1,600 deaths. In 2010, an 8.8 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami in Chile killed more than 500 people and caused some $30 billion in damage, wrecking hundreds of thousands of homes and mangling highways and bridges. \"This insurance will allow Chile to receive pre-established compensation payments for up to the maximum coverage, in the event of certain high-intensity parameterized seismic events that cause material damage to the country and public finances,\" the ministry said. \"If an earthquake is greater than a particular threshold and occurs in a particular zone and depth, the insurance provides for a specific payout associated with the event, which, on average, occurs approximately every 70 years,\" it added.","38":"SANTIAGO, March 15 (Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric said on Wednesday that the government will strengthen border security in the north in an effort to reduce the flow of unauthorized immigration. In addition to infrastructure and surveillance improvements, Boric said his government will carry out \"intense\" diplomatic activity with Bolivia and Venezuela to receive deported citizens. \"The administrative procedures to be able to carry out expulsion procedures are very cumbersome,\" Boric said, adding that the current system is a major obstacle in deporting foreigners that commit crimes. \"Our priority is to protect the border to ensure migration that is regular, safe and orderly and that also meets the needs of the country,\" Boric told reporters during a visit to Colchane, a highland town on the border with Bolivia. Since the end of February, more than 600 soldiers have been deployed in the north to work with the police in immigration control. Boric said planned improvements to the Colchane border complex include new thermal cameras and a satellite communication system \"to double the remote detection capacity and monitor areas currently not controlled.\" The improvements will be extended to six other observation points, including the Arica region that borders Peru. The leftist president, who has hardened his discourse against irregular immigration, said the announced measures also seek to combat criminal organizations that commit crimes involving human trafficking, drug trafficking and weapons. Earlier, in an interview with local radio, Boric said that \"at the beginning of April we are going to have a meeting with different friendly presidents of Latin America with AMLO, with Alberto Fernandez, with Xiomara Castro, with Gustavo Petro, with Luis Arce, where one of the topics that we are going to deal with is precisely this\", but did not give more details.","39":"INDIAN WELLS, California, March 12 (Reuters) - Chilean Cristian Garin's aggressive play overwhelmed Casper Ruud at Indian Wells on Sunday as the qualifier upset the third seed 6-4 7-6(2) to book a spot in the last 16. Garin pounded 27 forehand winners and fought off a second set comeback attempt to dispatch the struggling Norwegian, who has yet to win consecutive matches this season. \"I'm so happy with the way that I played,\" said Garin. \"I played so aggressive the whole match, even in the second set when I was leading 3-1 and lost those games.\" With the win Garin, a former top 20 player now ranked 97th, improved his career record against Ruud to 3-1. \"Casper is one of the players I really, really like on the tour so it's very special to me,\" said the Chilean. Ruud is still searching for the sensational form that saw him make the finals of the French Open and U.S. Open and soar up the rankings last year. Garin will next face Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina who beat Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-3 1-6 6-4. German 12th seed Alexander Zverev dug deep to beat Emil Ruusuvuori 7-5 1-6 7-5 despite admitting he was not at his best. \"To be honest I thought he played much better than me throughout the match,\" said Zverev. \"That's just the way it is sometimes... This is tennis, one or two points can decide a match and I'm happy that I won those points.\" Zverev will next face red-hot Russian Daniil Medvedev, who continued his recent streak of dominance that led to three consecutive titles with a 6-2 3-6 6-1 win over Belarusian Ilya Ivashka. Fifth seed Medvedev looked like he would make quick work of Ivashka after a one-sided first set but ran into trouble in the second where he grew agitated with some noisy fans on a windy night on center court. He corrected course in the third, however, breaking to take a 2-0 lead and cruising to the finish. Earlier in the day Britain's Cameron Norrie, seeded 10th, fought back to beat Japanese player Taro Daniel 6-7(5) 7-5 6-2 as the 2021 champion looks to add a second Indian Wells title to his collection. He will next play Russian sixth seed Andrey Rublev. American Frances Tiafoe, seeded 14th, will face Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the round of 16 after both players advanced in straight sets. On the women's side, seventh-seeded Maria Sakkari of Greece kept her title hopes alive by battling back to beat Ukrainian Anhelina Kalinina 3-6 6-2 6-4. Sakkari drew Kalinina to the net with a drop shot and then fired a backhand winner down the line on match point to complete the comeback. The Greek leaned over and pumped her fists in celebration after sealing the win on a hot day in the Southern California desert. \"I don't mind winning ugly,\" she told reporters. \"It doesn't really matter. I just give myself another chance to play better the next day.\" Sakkari, a finalist in Indian Wells last year, will next face 17th seed Karolina Pliskova in the round of 16 after the Czech beat Russia's Veronika Kudermetova 6-1 7-5. Third-seeded American Jessica Pegula edged Russia's Anastasia Potapova 3-6 6-4 7-5 to set up a meeting with Petra Kvitova after the 15th-seeded Czech won a rollercoaster match against Jelena Ostapenko 0-6 6-0 6-4. Sweden's Rebecca Peterson dispatched Jil Teichmann of Switzerland 3-6 6-3 6-1, 16th seeded Czech Barbora Krejcikova beat China's Wang Xinyu 6-2 7-6(1) 6-2, and sixth-seeded American teenager Coco Gauff beat Czech Linda Noskova 6-4 6-3. Belarusian second seed Aryna Sabalenka advanced via walkover when her Ukrainian opponent Lesia Tsurenko withdrew.","40":"SANTIAGO, March 10 (Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric, who has been struggling with low approval ratings since taking office a year ago, announced a major cabinet reshuffle on Friday, including the foreign minister. Alberto van Klaveren, who was Chile's ambassador to the European Union from 2001 to 2006 and served as undersecretary of foreign affairs from 2006 to 2009 under former President Michelle Bachelet, will replace Antonia Urrejola as minister of foreign affairs. Boric also named new ministers for public works, culture, sports and science ministries and changed undersecretaries for several ministries including for finance, transportation and agriculture. \"We're entering our second year of government and after a conscious evaluation, I've decided to make changes to my cabinet,\" Boric said at a press conference from La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago on the eve of his first anniversary in power. \"What motivates me to make these changes aren't political pressures or minor wins, the goal of these changes is to improve our capacity to respond and improve to the challenges facing our country.\" Boric's low approval ratings hit just 25% in late January before bouncing back to 35% in early March. A tax reform package, important to Boric's ambitious agenda of expanding social rights, was shelved by Congress on Wednesday. This is Boric's second major cabinet reshuffle. The first was after a proposed progressive new constitution was widely rejected by voters last September. Boric made headlines when he initially announced his young, female-led cabinet last March, but a number of controversies and missteps have led the president to name more experienced and centrist politicians to his cabinet. Kenneth Bunker, a political analyst with Politico Tech Global, said that while Friday's cabinet reshuffle highlights Boric's gradual shift to the center since taking office, it could be insufficient to deal with the government's underlying problems. \"I think this government's main problem has been political and strategic, not sector-based, and these cabinet changes are sector-based,\" Bunker said. \"So the problems the government has with sloppiness, timing, when to address topics or not, like (Wednesday's) tax reform, aren't going to be solved with this cabinet change.\"","41":"SANTIAGO, March 8 (Reuters) - The government of Chilean leftist President Gabriel Boric suffered a major setback on Wednesday after lawmakers refused to move forward with a proposed tax reform meant to finance key elements of the president's progressive agenda. The tax reform aimed to ultimately collect up to 3.6% of gross domestic product and proposed a mining royalty, which is also being discussed separately. With 73 votes in favor and 71 against, lawmakers dismissed the bill presented last July. It needed 79 votes to move forward. The government can still try to move the initiative through the Senate, where it does not have a majority. Finance Minister Mario Marcel expressed regret over the bill's rejection, and said he and Boric would discuss ways to move the government's agenda forward. \"We are not now in a position to define exactly what steps will be taken,\" he told a news conference. He called the rejection \"an issue of the greatest political, economic and social gravity.\" The expected added revenues were destined to fund future reforms in the pension and health systems, some of the key promises made by the government. The proposed reform included adjustments for income tax, a wealth tax, the reduction of exemptions, measures against evasion, and greater spending on tax incentives.","42":"SANTIAGO, March 6 (Reuters) - Chile launched a program on Monday to protect the huemul, an endangered southern deer, by creating a biological corridor that includes an area recently donated by the family of the late philanthropist and founder of the North Face, Douglas Tompkins. The Rewilding Chile Foundation, Tompkins' legacy, along with Chile's Ministry of Agriculture, said that the \"Huemul National Corridor\" will be made up of approximately 16 connected, state-protected areas alongside other private conservation initiatives. \"This public-private initiative seeks to reduce threats to the species, strengthen huemul populations in key conservation areas of the Patagonian Park Route,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that it will also build the world's first Rescue, Rehabilitation and Reproduction Center for Huemuls. Last week, Kristine Tompkins, co-founder and president of Rewilding Chile, met with President Gabriel Boric to donate 93,492 hectares (231,024 acres) for the creation of a new national park in the Magallanes region. \"This is one of the reasons that this park is so important not only for Chile but for the world,\" Tompkins told Reuters, adding that Southern Chile is an important source of carbon sequestration due to its peat bogs and untouched forests. \"This is a 'great goal' for conservation and fighting against the climate crisis.\" The huemul is one of two species of native deer found only in the Patagonian forests of Argentina and Chile. But habitat degradation has reduced the huemul to less than 1% of its original population, according to ministry data. Adult huemuls, also known as güemuls, can reach about 1.55 meters (5.1 feet) in length, 80-90 cm (31.5-35.5 inches) in height and weigh up to 68 kg (150 lb). They are herbivores and live for about 14 years. Despite being originally found in areas in central Chile, the huemul can now be seen mainly in the southernmost regions of Aysen and Magallanes. \"A species like the huemuls will not survive if all its places are not connected and this is a very broad vision that will serve as a model in many other parts of the world and will be the act that saves this species,\" Tompkins said.","43":"SANTIAGO, March 6 (Reuters) - Chile has begun its second attempt to write a new constitution as a group of experts that Congress appointed to start preparing a preliminary draft was installed on Monday. The new proposal is expected to be more moderate than the first one, which voters overwhelmingly rejected last September and which would have been one of the world's most progressive charters. The experts will work for three months on 12 institutional bases that lawmakers agreed to when they gave the green light to start the process at the end of last year. Independent lawyer Veronica Undurraga, who the center-left PPD party appointed to the commission, was elected its president. A 14-member Technical Admissibility Committee also starts on Monday to serve as arbitrator. The draft will be then given to an elected Constitutional Council. Citizens will elect the council’s 50 members on May 7. It will then work off the experts' draft in June, while the vote to approve or reject the proposed text will be held on Dec. 17. \"After the experience of the failed rewrite of 2021-22, it seems likely that voters will endorse moderation in both May’s vote for the Council and then in the ensuing referendum. Assuming all goes to plan, Chile will have a new constitution by the end of this year,\" consultancy Teneo said. The current constitution dates back to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship, although it has undergone dozens of reforms over the years.","44":"March 2 (Reuters) - Chile's SQM (SQMA.SN), the world's second-largest lithium producer, on Thursday posted fourth-quarter net profit more than triple that of a year earlier, just beating estimates on surging demand and tight supplies for the white metal. A scramble for lithium - which SQM extracts from brine from South America's sprawling salt flats - has sent prices soaring in recent years as car makers look to produce more electric vehicles (EVs) to comply with more stringent climate rules. SQM posted a quarterly net profit of $1.15 billion for the three months to Dec. 31, 2022, edging ahead of an average estimate of $1.14 billion by analysts polled by Refinitiv. Revenue for the quarter also nearly tripled to $3.13 billion, beating an average estimate of $2.99 billion, lifting core earnings to $1.67 billion. Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said he was \"well pleased with the extraordinary results.\" Profits were fueled by record sales volumes for lithium and its derivatives, which SQM mostly ships to Asia, the company said. Some sales anticipated this year were brought forward ahead of an expected end to Chinese EV subsidies, it said. SQM posted fourth-quarter lithium volumes up 38% year-on-year to 43,000 tonnes, selling at a record average of $59,000 a tonne. A year earlier, lithium sold for just $14,600 a tonne. In a separate statement, SQM said it planned to invest around $3.4 billion from 2023 to 2025, focusing on expanding its Chilean lithium capacities. The roadmap includes a $1.2 billion investment earmarked for this year. SQM said it expects to grow its lithium capacity from 210,000 tonnes forecast this year to 265,000 in 2025 as plants in southwestern Australia and China's Sichuan come online. SQM sells iodine as well and it said prices for the chemical used in X-rays also hit a record in the fourth quarter, predicting higher sales volumes and prices this year as it works to expand its capacity.","45":"SANTIAGO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Chile is finalizing a deal with the World Bank for insurance against high-intensity earthquakes that would impact the country's fiscal policy and public debt, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday. \"The insurance would allow Chile to receive pre-established compensation payments, in the event of certain high-intensity parameterized seismic events that cause material damage to the country and public finances,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"The specific conditions of the insurance will be disclosed once this financial operation is completed, which would eventually occur in the coming weeks.\" The government said that studies to design different financial insurance structures with the World Bank - through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)- began in June 2022. Chile is prone to earthquakes as it is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire. It has been hit by some of the strongest recorded earthquakes in the world, including a record 9.5 magnitude quake in 1960 in the southern city of Valdivia. The South American country was also struck by a devastating 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2010 that left more than 500 dead. The government said that the IBRD intends to issue a catastrophic bond, or cat-bond, that replicates the coverage structure of the policy.","46":"Feb 22 (Reuters) - Portugal sealed a 2-1 victory over Cameroon and Haiti defeated Chile 2-1 in the final qualifying playoffs in New Zealand on Wednesday, securing berths for both winners at soccer's upcoming Women's World Cup. Portugal will be in Group E at the World Cup alongside defending champions United States, Vietnam and the Netherlands, while Haiti will be in Group D with England, Denmark and China. Paraguay and Panama will meet on Thursday to decide the final team that will qualify for this year's World Cup, which will be the first edition to feature 32 teams. The event will be held in New Zealand and Australia from July 20 to Aug. 20. Portugal, who secured World Cup qualification for the first time, made a solid start at Waikato Stadium in Hamilton and went 1-0 ahead in the 22nd minute after defender Diana Gomes scored from a rebound following a free kick. Portugal could have made it 2-0 before the break but Jessica Silva failed to connect with Diana Silva's cross in the box. Diana later had a thumping effort saved by the goalkeeper and she also sent an acrobatic shot wide early in the second half. Cameroon's Michaela Abam had a goal ruled out for offside in the 84th minute but Ajara Nchout finally equalised five minutes later when she latched on to a pass from Monique Ngock and scored on the turn, unleashing a left-footed shot. Portugal were handed a penalty in stoppage time for a handball by Estelle Johnson, and Carole Costa made no mistake in finding the net from the spot. Haiti will also play at the World Cup for the first time after two goals by Melchie Dumonay guided them to victory at North Harbour Stadium in Auckland. Midfielder Dumonay opened the scoring at the stroke of half time with a powerful strike into the top corner as she finished off a brilliant team move and followed it up with a celebratory backflip. Striker Roselord Borgella missed an opportunity to add another before the break and captain Nerilia Mondesir had a penalty kick saved in the 89th minute after Isidora Olave was penalised for a shirt pull in the box following a VAR review. Mondesir later made amends by setting up the second goal for Dumonay, who doubled their lead in the eighth minute of stoppage time with a low shot into the bottom corner. Maria Rojas found the net for Chile soon after following a goalkeeping error, but it proved to be a consolation goal as they failed to secure a second successive appearance at the World Cup.","47":"VESOUL, France, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The appeal trial in France of a Chilean man found guilty of murdering his Japanese ex-girlfriend in 2016 was suspended until Thursday, after the accused appeared in court without a lawyer. Last year, a court found Nicolas Zepeda guilty of murdering 21-year-old Narumi Kurosaki in Besançon, in eastern France in a trial that made national headlines in France, Chile and Japan. Zepeda, who was sentenced to 28 years in jail, said he was innocent and appealed the verdict. Kurosaki's body has not been found. The appeal trial was initially due to start on Tuesday, but was suspended as the accused no longer had a lawyer. The court agreed to postpone the opening of the trial to Thursday, so a new lawyer could prepare for the hearings, the presiding judge François Arnaud said. Randall Schwerdorffer, a lawyer for Kurosaki's family, said that Zepeda had had a year to prepare for the appeal trial and that what he called \"toxic\" changes were taking their toll on Kurosaki's family, who travelled to France for the hearings. \"Whether Mr Zepeda agrees or not, this appeal trial will take place ...\" Schwerdorffer said, adding: \"I'm looking forward for the trial to resume... so we can go to the bottom of this.\" The court quoted Zepeda's lawyer as saying in a letter sent to the tribunal a few days ago that his client had made clear that he did not want him as his legal representative anymore. However, the accused's father, Humberto Zepeda, said he was unhappy with the proceedings. \"Do you think a (new) lawyer can in one day understand all the details of a case so complex as this?,\" he told reporters outside the tribunal, adding that this was \"impossible\" and his son was not receiving fair treatment. He said they did not know heading into the trial that his lawyer would not be there, and added: \"All we want is for the trial to take place in the best conditions possible and to recognise the innocence of our son.\"","48":"Feb 16 (Reuters) - Portugal and Chile start with a slight advantage as 10 teams battle it out for the remaining three berths at this year's Women's World Cup in the final qualifying playoffs over the next week in New Zealand. Cameroon, Haiti, Panama, Paraguay, Senegal, Thailand, Taiwan and Papua New Guinea are also involved in the tournament, which will complete the field for the first 32-team Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia later this year. At 22nd in the world, Portugal are the highest-ranked team in the tournament and they await the winners of Saturday's clash between Cameroon and Thailand in Hamilton. Like six of the other teams, Portugal have never played at the World Cup but winger Jessica Silva is convinced they will be able to stamp their ticket to the 2023 edition next Wednesday at the same Waikato Stadium. \"We know that Cameroon and Thailand have both been to the last two Women's World Cups and that it won't be easy,\" she told FIFA.com. \"But we really believe that we will make it. Portugal simply have to be at the World Cup.\" Chile made their debut at the last World Cup and they too will play only one competitive match in New Zealand next Wednesday, when they take on the winners of Saturday's game between Haiti and Senegal with a World Cup berth on the line. The other four teams play a straightforward knockout tournament starting on Sunday when Taiwan take on Paraguay in Hamilton and Papua New Guinea face Panama in Auckland. The winners will meet in Hamilton next Thursday in a game that will decide the final qualifier for the ninth Women's World Cup. Panama are among the lowest-ranked teams at the tournament and are not alone in hoping that getting to the global showpiece might prove a catalyst for women's football back home. \"Qualifying would be a watershed moment for this group,\" said Ignacio Quintana, coach of the 57th ranked Canaleras. \"We also know that when we have that World Cup ticket, parents are going to trust more and take their daughters to train in football and break that paradigm that sadly still exists a lot in Latin America that only men can play football.\" New Zealand are using the tournament as a test event for their co-hosting of the first World Cup in the southern hemisphere, which starts on July 20. Their Football Ferns will play Portugal and Argentina in two of six friendlies surrounding the tournament, allowing all the teams to make the most of the long journey to New Zealand.","49":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - A third inquiry into the death of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda 50 years ago could shed new light on whether he was poisoned by political enemies, as alleged by some of his family. The latest expert report, presented to a court on Wednesday, will be reviewed by judges in closed hearings ahead of a legally binding ruling on the poet's death in 1973 shortly before the Pinochet dictatorship came to power. Rodolfo Reyes, a Neruda nephew, reiterated this week claims that his uncle - a member of the Communist party and the most important Chilean intellectual of the time - was poisoned. \"(He was) murdered by agents of the state. Is there any doubt?\" he told reporters outside the court. He said he did not have access to the report. Earlier he told Spanish news agency EFE he had seen laboratory documents that supported the poisoning hypothesis. An international forensics group in 2017 raised doubts as to whether Neruda died of prostate cancer at age 69 and did not rule out foul play. Previous tests have found no evidence Neruda, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1971, was poisoned. The report's coordinator, Dr Gloria Ramirez, made no comment on Reyes' speculation about its findings, whose presentation to the court was delayed twice. It has not been made public because of judicial rules governing the inquiry. Judge Paola Plaza, who is overseeing the case, said there is no deadline on delivering a verdict. Neruda was a friend and adviser to Chilean socialist President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a coup led by Augusto Pinochet in September 1973.","50":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mito Pereira, who squandered a chance at last year's PGA Championship to become the first Chilean to win one of golf's four majors, is headed to LIV Golf with Colombian Sebastian Munoz, the Saudi-backed circuit said on Wednesday. Pereira and Munoz, who are joining a Torque GC team that features captain Joaquin Niemann and Spaniard David Puig, will make their LIV Golf debut next week in Mexico for the first event of the 14-tournament schedule. Pereira was playing in only his second major at last year's PGA Championship where he calmly built a three-shot lead heading into the final round. But the pressure of a major proved to be Pereira's undoing as he squandered a one-shot advantage on the 18th hole where he drove into a creek off the tee en route to a double-bogey that knocked him out of a playoff. Munoz, who missed the cut in his most recent PGA Tour start at last month's Farmers Insurance Open, has one win on the U.S.-based circuit having triumphed at the 2019 Sanderson Farms Championship. Instead of announcing all its members at once, LIV Golf is unveiling players over three days this week with four squads announced each day starting on Wednesday.","51":"MEXICO CITY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Mexican telecommunications giant America Movil (AMXL.MX) reported on Tuesday a 90% drop in its fourth-quarter net profit from the same period a year earlier, mainly due to the deconsolidation of Claro Chile and currency headwinds. Net profit stood at $703 million (13.71 billion pesos), down from $6.8 billion (132 billion pesos). The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, in October received regulatory approval to launch a joint venture in Chile with VTR. The firm's subsidiary, Claro Chile, in order to comply with antitrust concerns, will transfer its satellite television service to a trustee who will divest the service to a third party. America Movil, in a statement to Mexico's main stock exchange, said net profit also took a hit \"due to the depreciation of the Chilean currency against the Mexican peso in recent years.\" The firm posted a 2.4% decrease in revenues, again partly driven by the appreciation of the Mexican peso versus other Latin American currencies. Revenues reached 215.962 billion pesos. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), or core earnings, was 84.8 billion pesos, a decrease of about 4.4% in nominal terms from a year ago. America Movil said it added 1.5 million postpaid customers in the quarter, driven by Brazil, Austria and Colombia. It also added 1.8 million prepaid customers, with the majority in Mexico. There were 110,000 new broadband accesses and 97,000 new Pay TV customers, while the company lost 234,000 voice access lines.

The Andean copper producing nation, currently battling deadly fires in the south-central region, is locked in a more than decade-long period of drought that has created a challenge to mining, agriculuture and bees. In the far south city of Punta Arenas, that has led to a water emergency declared last year. \"In 2022 Punta Arenas had its driest year in 52 years,\" said Nicolas Butorovic, a climatologist from the regional University of Magallanes. The Magallanes region, an area of fjords and large expanses of ice that is home to the iconic Torres del Paine national park, usually creaks under cold temperatures and strong winds that have exacerbated the dry conditions. \"The wind picks up and dries everything and the grass does not grow, that is the drama we're facing,\" said Hector Garay, a livestock farmer in the region. Cristian Vivar, owner of a local dairy, said the region was facing a \"very difficult winter\" ahead due to the lack of water to grow animal feed. \"If there is no irrigation water, water from rain, the grass does not grow. We are talking about what is going to be missing, food for our cattle,\" he said. Bernardita Contreras said her first batch of a rhubarb crop had survived but there was no chance for the second one. \"There is no longer any hope of recovering it because there's no water, we don't have any to irrigate,\" she said. In the popular region for travel, Rodrigo Bustamante, president of the hotels and tourism services association, said the whole area was dry. \"This year is much hotter than others, with much more wind, which is also an ingredient that dries the countryside much more and dries the entire territory,\" he said.","53":"RIO FUTA, Chile, Feb 10 (Reuters) - As his parents fought wildfires threatening their home in southern Chile, 13-year-old Lucas Cespedes decided to take action, ferrying firefighters across the local river in a small yellow rowing boat to help them put out the flames. The Andean country is battling some of the worst wildfires in years that have claimed 24 lives and burned through over 340,000 hectares (840,158 acres), affecting more than 5,400 people and destroying over a thousand homes. \"I ferried people across the river because I was desperate, my parents were fighting the fire and I was very scared that the fire would reach my house,\" said Cespedes, who lives with his family in an area only accessible by water. \"There was no other person who could ferry people, so the only hope was me.\" Cespedes rowed the firefighters across 30 meters (98 ft)of the Futa River, a mighty waterway in Chile's south near the city of Valdivia, about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) south of the capital Santiago. He has kept doing so as fires have raged on. \"Now I continue helping, I continue ferrying people across, bringing the firefighters,\" added Cespedes. The fires have been concentrated in the agricultural and forestry regions of central south Chile and come in the midst of a prolonged drought of over a decade that has impacted farming, city landscapes and mining in the world's no. 1 copper producer. Climate change increases hot and dry conditions that help fires spread faster, burn longer and rage more intensely.","54":"CHILLAN, Chile, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Forest fires across south-central Chile that have left 24 people dead and swallowed up hundreds of houses spread into new areas on Wednesday after raging overnight, burning up the habitats of vulnerable woodland animals. \"We call on everyone who can to take care of the forests which are currently on fire, and also of our animals, specimens of vital importance,\" said Valentina Aravena, the manager at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Chillan. Chile's national forests association CONAF said on Wednesday the area affected by the fires had now spread to over 300,000 hectares (741,315 acres), an area nearly twice the size of Greater London. Authorities said some 2,180 people have been injured and 1,180 houses have been destroyed, with most of the deaths and damages in the south-central Biobio, Araucania and Ñuble regions. Late on Wednesday, Interior Minister Carolina Toha said the government would declare a curfew in some provinces starting on Thursday. She had earlier warned of a shortage of water tanks and urged providers to make them available. In the rehabilitation center in Chillan, the capital of the Ñuble region, veterinarians treated burns on animals native to the woodlands, such as monito del monte, a small nocturnal marsupial, and pudus, the world's smallest deer. Aravena said these were essential species that helped spread seeds. \"We try to stabilize them, treat them, relieve pain from the burns they suffered, and ideally rehabilitate them so they can return to the wild,\" she said. In the vicinity of the nearby city of Quillon, local Enrique Narvaez watched firefighters at work overnight. \"The 2011 wildfire burnt down my house, all the trees, everything,\" he said. \"I don't want to go through the same again now.\" Chilean President Gabriel Boric thanked his Brazilian counterpart who offered $672,000 in aid and said he was sending air force jet with firefighting equipment, personnel and experts. Spain, Colombia and Mexico are also giving assistance. Chilean pulp and wood panel manufacturer Arauco [RIC:RIC:ANTCOC.UL], the forestry arm of Empresas Copec (COPEC.SN), said 40,000 hectares (98,842 acres) of its plantations could be potentially affected, though the possible extent remained unclear. A day earlier, a Chilean minister warned that high temperatures forecast for this week could further complicate the situation.","55":"QUILLON, Chile, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Chilean authorities on Tuesday warned of a \"very complex\" situation as a new heat wave in the country's south-central region threatened to further fan the flames of dangerous forest fires that have already left 24 dead. Over 293,000 hectares (724,000 acres) have been ravaged by fires this season, and forecasts for higher temperatures stretching from Santiago to the southern regions that have been the focal point of the flames have raised concerns about the 82 active fires. Another 174 fires are under control. High temperatures are forecast through Friday and could rise above 35 degrees Celsius (95°F) in the central Maule y Ñuble regions, \"creating a very complex situation in terms of weather,\" Deputy Interior Minister Manuel Monsalve told reporters. Later Tuesday, Monsalve said the government had confirmed 24 people had died from the fires, revising a previously reported toll of 26 victims. Monsalve said international fire brigades from Colombia and Mexico were assisting. He said 17 people had been arrested for possible links to starting the fires, several of them for activities such as welding or burning clothing and animal wool. Air quality in the affected areas has deteriorated significantly due to the smoke from the fires, said Health Minister Ximena Aguilera. Chile's massive pulp and paper company CMPC said in a statement on Tuesday that over 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) of its plantations have been affected by the fires, while operations at some of its processing plants had been halted.","56":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay officially submitted a joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup on Tuesday, calling for the tournament to return \"where football was born\" 100 years after the first World Cup was held in Montevideo.

Not only on the centenary of the first edition, but because of the passion with which we live football.\" Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez made a statement on his official Twitter account saying that Bolivia will be asked to join \"this dream\". After the first edition in Uruguay, Argentina hosted the World Cup in 1978 and Chile in 1962, while Paraguay has never hosted the sport's biggest competition. The South American bid will compete with Spain-Portugal, who have signed a joint bid agreement, plus possible 2030 bids from Morocco and Saudi Arabia.","57":"SANTIAGO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Chilean firefighters were battling to hold back forest fires on Monday as authorities said hot and dry weather would continue this week, potentially exacerbating what are already the deadliest blazes in the country's recent history. The fires, which have consumed 270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) of land, have killed 26 people so far in south-central Chile, and already made 2023 the second worst year in terms of hectares burned after the so-called \"fire storm\" that hit the country in 2017. The state National Forestry Corporation reported that as of Monday morning there were 275 active fires, of which 69 were currently in combat. \"Unity to face the tragedy, unity to rebuild ourselves,\" President Gabriel Boric wrote on Twitter. Chile is in the grip of an over decade-long period of dry weather, which the World Meteorological Organization called a \"mega drought\" last year, adding it was the longest in a thousand years and marked a major water crisis.\nThe heat wave and strong winds have caused a rapid spread of the flames during the Southern Hemisphere summer season. The country's interior minister said on Monday that 11 people so far have been arrested for actions related to the fires, without providing details the nature of the suspected crimes because of ongoing investigations. On Friday, Boric pointed to signs that some of the fires may have been started intentionally. Between Sunday and Monday, aid arrived in Chile from Argentina, Spain and Mexico, while the authorities said they expected to receive new support from Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal and Venezuela. The fires have not affected the mining industry in the world's top copper producing nation, with mines located mostly in the north of the country, but they have hit Chile's agricultural and major forestry sector. The Chilean Wood Corporation, an industry association, told Reuters on Monday that its partners are currently focused on the emergency and do not yet have a preliminary assessment of the impact.","58":"SANTIAGO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Firefighters battled dozens of raging wildfires in Chile on Sunday, seeking to gain control of one of the country's worst natural disasters in years as the death toll rose to at least 24 with nearly 1,000 more injured. International help began arriving on Sunday from a handful of countries that have pledged resources, including planes and expert firefighting teams, as the most intense wildfires torched forests and farmland clustered around three regions near the middle of the South American country's long Pacific coastline. President Gabriel Boric issued emergency declarations for the largely rural southern regions of Biobio, Nuble and Araucania in an effort to speed relief. On Sunday, speaking from the city of Puren in Araucania, Boric stressed that his government would provide all necessary resources, while he also sought to inspire solidarity in the face of the deadly wildfires. \"I've seen the resiliency of our people, and it's exactly that spirit that has to guide us during this difficult time,\" he said. \"All together, we'll come out of this ahead.\" The fires have consumed some 270,000 hectares, officials said on Sunday, or an area roughly the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island. A searing heat wave in the Southern Hemisphere's summer has complicated efforts to extinguish the flames, as temperatures in some of the most affected areas have exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius). Pockets of intense fire could be seen leaping out from the forested hills off the coast near the town of Dichato just outside the city of Concepcion in the Biobio region on Saturday night, as light from the flames illuminated boats in the small harbor. Thirteen of the dead -- more than half of the fires' reported victims -- come from Biobio, which, like Nuble and Araucania, is home to extensive forests as well as farms that grow grapes and other fruit for export. In some places, the fires prompted a mad dash for safety for those lucky enough to have options ahead of the approaching flames. \"Get into the swimming pool! Get into the swimming pool, up to your neck,\" a woman recounted shouting to her parents at the family's home near the town of Santa Juana, in hard-hit Biobio, but declining to give her name. She described a hurried effort to find a safe place to hunker down that included leaving behind vehicles, as well as imploring neighbors to join them in the pool. Some 260 fires are active across the parched region, interior ministry officials said on Sunday, with 28 of them considered especially dangerous. Nearly 1,500 people have fled to area shelters. At least 26 of the 970 injured are listed in grave condition at local hospitals. Chilean officials have sought international assistance to battle the fires, with new ones sparking to life each day. Authorities said they were facilitating the arrival of assistance from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal and Venezuela. Some foreign help was already on the ground. A Spanish military unit was to make it, officials said on Sunday, adding that a so-called Ten Tanker plane featuring a 36,000-liter firefighting capacity should arrive on Monday. Meanwhile, a specialized team of personnel and trucks from Argentina also arrived on Sunday, as did two military planes and around 300 volunteers from Mexico, according to Chile's foreign ministry.","59":"SANTIAGO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Dozens of wildfires blazing though Chile caused the government to extend an emergency order to another region on Saturday, as a scorching summer heat wave complicates efforts to control fires that have claimed at least 23 lives so far. More than 1,100 people have sought refuge in shelters while at least 979 people have been reported injured by the raging fires, according to an official briefing later on Saturday. The latest emergency order covers the southern region of Araucania, next to the previously declared Biobio and Nuble regions, located near the middle of the South American country's long Pacific coastline. \"Weather conditions have made it very difficult to put out (the fires) that are spreading and the emergency is getting worse,\" Interior Minister Carolina Toha told reporters at a news conference in the capital Santiago. \"We need to reverse that curve,\" she added, noting that on Friday 76 more fires had ignited. Another 16 fires sparked to life on Saturday, according to officials, as local temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere summer exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius). The sparsely populated three regions covered by the emergency orders are home to many farms, including where grapes, apples and berries are grown for export, plus extensive tracts of forest land. Officials told reporters on Saturday that the governments of Spain, the United States, Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela have offered help, including planes and firefighters. On Friday, an emergency-support helicopter in La Araucania crashed, killing its pilot and a mechanic, according to officials. Authorities reported that 11 of the victims, or nearly half of the casualties reported so far, died in the town of Santa Juana in Biobio, located some 310 miles (500 km) south of Santiago. Since late last week, helicopters have dropped fire retardant over raging fires as billowing clouds of smoke obstruct roadways. Firefighters and local residents alike are struggling to contain the flames against the backdrop of a hazy orange-tinted sky. The orders allow for the deployment of soldiers and additional resources to deal with the natural disaster. Some 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) have been burnt by the fires, according to official data released late on Friday, an area larger than the U.S. city of Philadelphia. National forestry agency CONAF reported on Saturday that 80 of 231 total wildfires are being actively battled, while 151 of them are under control. Officials said that over 90% of the wildfires have been smothered before they spread beyond 12 acres (5 hectares). But for those unlucky enough to get caught up in one of the uncontrolled wildfires, immediate evacuation was the only option. \"I left with what I had on,\" said Carolina Torres, who fled from an approaching fire near the city of Puren, in the region of Araucania. \"I think everyone here did the same thing because the winds shifted and you just had to grab everything right away.\" On Friday, President Gabriel Boric cut short his summer vacation and traveled to Nuble and Biobio, pledging to make sure the affected areas receive all necessary support.

Some 200 hectares have also been ravaged in another part of the Nuble region, it added. \"It's like your life is over,\" said Juan Pradenas, a mechanic whose home in Chillan was destroyed by the fire. \"At my age, I have to start fighting again to recover my equipment, I lost all my working tools.\" \"It is terrible,\" added Rosa Torres, who lives near Chillan. \"The fire was there, we could see it from afar and then the wind changed and in the blink of an eye the fire was here.\" Chile's Interior Ministry declared a red alert for Nuble region and Biobio region, further south, as it looks to secure more funding to fight the blaze in areas of more intense forestry and agricultural production. The ministry has also temporarily closed seven national parks in Santiago and some of Chile's southern regions due to the risk of new fires. The authorities also ordered the evacuation of rural areas of Nuble region due to the risk of fire. The government also fears that the Puelche - a phenomenon of hot, dry wind which is expected to arrive over central and southern Chile shortly - could pile on challenges to a region already registering temperatures of 42°C (108°F). \"It is a very complex combination,\" Agriculture Minister Esteban Valenzuela told journalists.","62":"SANTIAGO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Copper production in Chile, the world's largest producer of the red metal, will grow at a slower rate this decade than previously hoped, a government report seen by Reuters showed, with peak output later and lower than estimated a year ago. Likely output of the red metal will peak at some 7.14 million tonnes in 2030, two years later than anticipated as delays hit mining projects in the Andean nation, according to an unpublished report from regulator Cochilco obtained by Reuters. That is well below the 7.62 million-tonne 2028 peak the regulator had estimated in its decade outlook a year ago. \"Lots of important projects in the next decade haven't advanced in engineering or environmental baselines during the pandemic,\" the report said, adding that its outlook was \"quite lower than projections made in previous years.\" Production snarls in Chile could prop up the global price of the metal, which has soared since 2020 past $9,000 per tonne. Also, protests in neighboring Peru have curbed production in major mines at the world's No. 2 copper producing country. Despite the expected slower growth in Chile, the report forecasts production to grow 17% to 6.58 million tonnes by 2033. Expected output will be 5.345 million tonnes in 2022, 5.467 million tonnes this year and 5.891 million tonnes in 2024. The report states that its projections depend on all planned mining projects in the current portfolio coming online, adding that projects to maintain and expand current mines would not be enough on their own to meet projections. \"It's necessary for all the new initiatives on the national investment portfolio to materialize, which would contribute 17% of production towards 2033,\" the report added. In a response to questions from Reuters, Cochilco research head Víctor Garay said the peak couldn't come earlier as new projects needed studies and analysis, which \"take a long time\". Chile's copper sector, the country's top exporter, has demanded more \"legal certainty\" for investment after the government recently denied permits for the Dominga iron and copper project and amid uncertainty over a new constitution. On Wednesday the chief executive of miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) said Chile expansion projects were on hold until the country's political situation was clearer. The report showed a production fall last year versus 2021 but said that this \"should close the cycle of production losses associated with the (COVID-19) pandemic.\" There will also be a likely production drop after the 2030 peak as some operations close or produce less \"without expected replacement projects that would allow continuity.\"","63":"SANTIAGO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Carmen Villegas, 56, a housewife in Santiago, was one of the millions of Chileans who turned out to vote for Gabriel Boric in 2021, propelling the young leader to the presidential palace amid optimism over his plans to reduce deep-seated inequality. But almost a year after coming into office in March 2022, Boric, 36, is now finding out the perils of leadership, with voters like Villegas growing disenchanted as inflation has hurt people's spending power and crime has risen. The moderate leftist's approval rating has halved from around 50% when he came into office to 25%, data from pollster Cadem show, with many Chileans complaining about his handling of the economy and saying his government has been soft on crime. \"There is a lot of chaos, especially when it comes to insecurity,\" said Villegas, who said she had hoped that he would bring a breath of fresh air after years of political leaders that she characterized as stuffy. \"I wanted to give a chance to a young person, without the problems of the older politicians,\" she said. \"But he hasn't done things well.\" Boric's flagging ratings pose a challenge for the progressive leader - and a warning for other regional leftists - after he had campaigned on plans to shake up the country's market-orientated economic model, push through mining and tax reforms, and strengthen environmental regulation. Missteps - and some misfortune - have hit those plans. His Cabinet, a mix of young reformers and technocrats, has faced criticism over a lack of experience, while a planned new constitution he supported was overwhelmingly rejected by voters. Recent pardons of 12 protesters convicted for crimes such as looting and robbery during 2019 riots went down badly amid rising crime statistics. The country, one of the region's most stable historically, saw murders rise 43% in 2022 and kidnappings go up 77%, according to police data. Chile in recent years has seen a jump in organized crime, apparently related to the drug trade. That has happened alongside a tough economic backdrop. Inflation was 13% last year, the highest since 1991, while the economy of the world's no. 1 copper producer is expected to be the only one in South America to contract in 2023, according to World Bank projections. Boric's trajectory from rising star to poll laggard could serve as a warning to other leftist leaders in the region that have ascended to power in a new 'pink tide'. \"The big lesson for other leftists surely is that governing is more difficult than being in opposition,\" said Nicholas Watson from consultancy Teneo, adding that Boric's \"borrowed\" moderate votes had evaporated quickly as reality hit home. The pardons of the protesters were widely criticized, torpedoing talks with conservative lawmakers over establishing a new security council and leading the justice minister and chief of staff to resign. The lower house has announced an investigation into the pardons. Boric's team say he was given incomplete information about the prisoners' convictions. \"I think (Boric) hasn't received the clear message that for people there's a security crisis that's a priority,\" said political analyst Kenneth Bunker. The president's spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment, but Boric has repeatedly acknowledged that his administration has made mistakes. During a news conference announcing the justice minister's resignation, Boric said the government was determined to \"strengthen political management.\" \"When situations like these happen in politics, we have to assume responsibility,\" Boric said, adding that members of his government must own up to errors. Seeking to woo investors and centrist voters, Boric has moderated some of his initial stances, including dialing back his campaign pledge to \"bury\" Chile's market-orientated economic model and tapping a former central bank head to be his finance minister. That has disillusioned his core leftist supporters. \"Sometimes it seems that he is ruling just so that the right does not get angry,\" said 46-year-old designer and Boric voter Gaston Gomez.","64":"SANTIAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The carcass of a lion in front Chile's presidential palace surprised passersby on Friday as zoo workers protested against a government agency they blame for the feline's death. Next to the corpse of Zeus, a 14-year-old male lion, a sign read \"The government kills animals\" as surprised passersby took photos and videos. The zoo's owners blame the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG), which required sedation in order to read animals' microchips. \"SAG forced us to capture and anesthetize all of our animals to read their microchips,\" said Cesar Chanampa, legal representative for the Los Angeles City Zoo, about 470 kilometers (290 miles) south of Santiago. \"We told them that animals face the same risks from anesthesia as humans do,\" Chanampa said. \"They made us stain our hands with blood.\" SAG said in a statement that sedation is standard procedure for the safety of the animal and personnel. \"Unfortunately, one of the animals that underwent this procedure died,\" the statement added. Chanampa said SAG should have more experienced and competent employees so anesthesia is not required just for reading microchips. SAG said the protest violated the animal's dignity and that it would consider taking legal action against the zoo, which it accused of \"inadequate handling of the animals.\" The police cordoned off the area outside the palace and later removed the lion's remains.","65":"Jan 16 (Reuters) - Scientists in Chile's Patagonia region are unearthing the southernmost dinosaur fossils recorded outside Antarctica, including remains of megaraptors that would have dominated the area's food chain before their mass extinction. Fossils of megaraptors, a carnivorous dinosaur that inhabited parts of South America during the Cretaceous period some 70 million years ago, were found in sizes up to 10 meters long, according to the Journal of South American Earth Sciences. \"We were missing a piece,\" Marcelo Leppe, director of the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), told Reuters. \"We knew where there were large mammals, there would also be large carnivores, but we hadn't found them yet.\" The remains, recovered from Chile's far south Rio de las Chinas Valley in the Magallanes Basin between 2016 and 2020, also include some unusual remains of unenlagia, velociraptor-like dinosaurs which likely lived covered in feathers. The specimens, according to University of Chile researcher Jared Amudeo, had some characteristics not present in Argentine or Brazilian counterparts. \"It could be a new species, which is very likely, or belong to another family of dinosaurs that are closely related,\" he said, adding more conclusive evidence is needed. The studies also shed more light on the conditions of the meteorite impact on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula that may have triggered the dinosaurs' extinction some 65 million years ago. INACH's Leppe pointed to a sharp drop in temperatures over present-day Patagonia and waves of intense cold lasting up to several thousand years, in contrast to the extremely warm climate that prevailed for much of the Cretaceous period. \"The enormous variation we are seeing, the biological diversity, was also responding to very powerful environmental stimuli,\" Leppe said. \"This world was already in crisis before (the meteorite) and this is evidenced in the rocks of the Rio de las Chinas Valley,\" he said.","66":"SANTIAGO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chilean authorities said on Wednesday they were investigating a violent heist in Chile's main seaport where thieves stole several shipping containers filled with copper belonging to state-owned giant Codelco. Juan Carlos Catalan, the local prosecutor, said in a statement that ten armed men entered the San Antonio port early on Tuesday morning, attacked workers and stole 13 containers, 12 of which had copper. \"There was one guard and four workers that (the assailants)tied up and beat and left locked up,\" Catalan said, adding that workers alerted authorities after they freed themselves. Catalan said authorities are investigating and reviewing security footage but have not detained any suspects. In a statement to Reuters, Codelco said the copper was scheduled to be exported and was insured. Citing police sources, local media reported the copper plates were worth an estimated $4.4 million. The heist is the largest copper theft since a spate of gangster heists in northern Chile last October forced the government to tighten security on trains carrying copper cathodes. The violent robbery adds pressure over shipment security in the world's largest copper producer. Mining companies in Chile have repeatedly complained about copper thefts by specialized gangs. Authorities blamed the train heists on international crime groups while police said Wednesday's heist could be a local group. \"It is a gang that may be working in San Antonio because we have other crimes with similar characteristics,\" local police captain Gonzalo Garcia told Radio Cooperativa, adding that it was a well-planned heist that involved multiple trucks. \"They cut off the security cameras and once the cameras were cut off, the other part of the gang went in to intimidate the guards and the workers.\"","67":"Jan 9 (Reuters) - Brazil's currency fell on Monday but was off its session low after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the capital, while Chile's peso hit seven-month highs, driven by a leap in copper prices. Supporters of the far-right Bolsonaro invaded and defaced the country's Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court in Brasilia on Sunday and continued protests on Monday, days after the leftist administration under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sworn-in following a close election win in October. Brazil's real , snapped a three-day winning run, last down 0.4% after falling over 1% earlier in the day. Stocks reversed declines to rise 0.6%, with shares of state-run oil major Petrobras (PETR4.SA) erased a chunk of its 2% session losses to last trade down 0.2% as oil prices jumped. Analysts expect the unrest and its impact on markets to be short-lived as authorities try to contain the protests, with the focus soon turning back macroeconomic indicators. \"Because of the swift government response, the market impact has been limited. But the riots could reduce pressure on Lula to present an economic plan in coming weeks and could also slow the reform agenda,\" said Elizabeth Johnson, managing director of Brazil research at TS Lombard. A central bank survey on Monday showed Brazil's inflation and interest rate expectations for the year had risen. While most other Latin American currencies also fell, underperforming broader emerging market peers, Chile's peso rose 0.8% as copper prices hit six-month highs. Data showed Chile posted a trade surplus of $1.85 billion in the month, up from a $417 million surplus in December 2021. In Mexico, the peso inched lower, snapping a five-day winning streak and retreating from over one-month highs. Data showed Mexico's headline inflation ended 2022 slightly below analysts' expectations, while core inflation appeared to have lost steam. Annual headline inflation in December reached 7.82%, up moderately from 7.80% in November. In Argentina, the economy will grow significantly more than 5% in 2023, Economy Minister Sergio Massa said on Sunday. Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1942 GMT:","68":"SANTIAGO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric called for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) on Monday to address riots in Brazil where supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed top government buildings. Boric, speaking alongside Colombia President Gustavo Petro outside La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, called Sunday's riots \"unacceptable\" and also condemned \"complicit silence.\" \"This situation is worrying for our countries, our region has to have a clear position,\" Boric said, adding that the meeting's goal is that the \"rest of the countries in the region can take a stance.\" Petro and Boric, both left-wing presidents who took power last year, have emphasized their support for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office on Jan. 1 after defeating Bolsonaro. Petro, a former rebel and Colombia's first leftist president, compared the attack to the 1973 Chilean coup against Salvador Allende. \"Today there are those who'd like to bring us back to the times of Allende,\" Petro said, noting a historical resistance to left-wing governments in the region. \"We just saw it in Brazil, but it's not just in Brazil,\" Petro said. \"It's time to say what happened here in this place 50 years ago won't happen again.\" The leaders also spoke about cooperation on aerospace technology, immigration and renewable energy, with a focus on green hydrogen. The OAS, which has 35 member states, promotes peace and economic development in the Americas. Boric and Petro also requested that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issue an opinion on the obligation of states regarding fundamental rights in the face of climate change.","69":"SANTIAGO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric on Friday pardoned 12 people connected with widespread protests against inequality in 2019 that left more than 30 dead. Political factions and organizations had called for the release of the people connected to violent protests that shook the South American country. As a candidate, Boric had talked about pardoning some of those convicted for less violent crimes after the protests. The list of those pardoned included men between the ages of 21 and 38 involved in various crimes such as looting, robbery, handling Molotov cocktails, and others. The move was celebrated by political allies with senator Fabiola Campillai, who was blinded during the protests before running for office, calling it a \"humanitarian act.\" Political opponents decried the move. \"It's a slap in the face to all Chileans that want more security,\" right-wing senator Gonzalo de la Carrera said on Twitter, saying the move disrupts negotiations currently under way to create a national safety council. Boric also pardoned a member of a rebel group on Friday for a total of 13 pardons. Jorge Mateluna, 48, is linked to the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), had been sentenced to 16 years in prison after being accused of participating in an assault on a branch in Santiago in June 2013.","70":"SANTIAGO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Chile plans to open an embassy in the Palestinian territories, President Gabriel Boric said late on Wednesday, which could make the Andean country one of only a handful to have an embassy-level office in the territories that are contested with Israel. Chilean Foreign Minister Antonia Urrejola confirmed the plan on Thursday but said there was no timeline in place yet and that Chile continues to recognize both Palestine and Israel as legitimate states. Leftist Boric, who has repeatedly expressed support for the Palestinian people's demand for an independent state, made the comments at a private ceremony in Santiago hosted by the city's important Palestinian diaspora. \"I am taking a risk (saying) this... we are going to raise our official representation in Palestine from having a charge d'affaires; now we are going to open an embassy,\" Boric said, without giving details on where the embassy would be located. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in Chile said it would not be making a public statement on the matter. The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of business hours. The Palestinian territories, which Palestinians want recognized as a state, encompass the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and contest control over East Jerusalem. Israel captured those areas in a 1967 Middle East war and there have been regular clashes since. The West Bank has experienced some of the worst levels of violence in more than a decade this year, much of it concentrated around Nablus and the nearby city of Jenin, with at least 150 Palestinians and more than 20 Israelis killed. Israeli forces killed a Palestinian combatant in clashes near a flashpoint site on Thursday, underlining the continuing violence in the occupied West Bank that will confront Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's incoming government. Netanyahu has secured a coalition with religious and ultranationalist partners who oppose Palestinian statehood and want to extend Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Chile's Boric said the embassy was meant to give Palestinians the representation they deserve and to demand that \"international law be respected.\" In September, Boric postponed receiving the credentials of Israel's new ambassador to Chile after Israeli forces killed a Palestinian teenager. Israel criticized the decision, saying it \"seriously\" harmed bilateral ties.","71":"Dec 22 (Reuters) - Dramatic elections in Brazil, Chile and Colombia brought leftist governments into power across much of Latin America in 2022, capping the region's second \"pink tide\" in two decades. However, their struggles amid stubborn economic headwinds suggest the wave may have crested. An anti-incumbent streak that lifted the left could soon swing major elections the other way. To have the same staying power as the left-wing renaissance at the turn of the century, governments will need to reignite economies that have frustrated voters and investors alike during a decade of mostly mediocre growth. Chilean President Gabriel Boric, 36, took office in March as his country's most progressive leader in half a century and its youngest ever. But setbacks including the rejection of a new constitution have dented his popularity and forced concessions to the center, including swapping some of the youthful cohort in his cabinet for more experienced establishment figures. Colombia also swung sharply to the left with June's election of Gustavo Petro, a 62-year-old former guerrilla vowing to tackle inequality with tax and land reforms. He has shored up fiscal concerns with the former, but spooked investors with a proposed ban on new oil and gas exploration and second-guessing of central bank policy. Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 77, who narrowly beat incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October, is a holdover from the region's first pink tide, when a commodity boom helped him finish his 2003-2010 presidency with record approval. However, corruption scandals and economic mismanagement under his chosen successor tarred Lula's legacy. Deep polarization, an aging workforce and a bigger public debt load will make it nearly impossible for him to repeat such sky-high popularity. While the domestic impacts are still playing out, Latin America's progressive slant - which also includes the previously elected presidents of Mexico, Argentina and Bolivia - has reshaped regional diplomacy. Many leftist leaders have taken a friendlier approach toward authoritarian governments in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, making it harder for the United States and allies to put on pressure. While Chile's Boric spoke out on human rights abuses under Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, both Petro and Lula have been eager to restore diplomatic ties with Caracas. The region's ideological sympathies were on display in December when Peru's leftist former President Pedro Castillo tried to dissolve Congress before it removed him from office in an impeachment vote. The governments of Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia and Honduras condemned Castillo's ouster, with some referring to it as a \"coup.\" The U.S. State department said it \"welcomes\" the appointment of his successor, President Dina Boluarte. Lula recognized Castillo's ouster as \"constitutional,\" but did not condemn his attempt to shut down the legislature. The region's new pink tide has a distinct green tint, as progressive movements have embraced the fight against climate change. While old guard leftists like Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are still bullish on fossil fuels, many of his peers are embracing renewable energy and conservation. Lula's top foreign adviser has called for Brazil to host a summit of Amazon rainforest nations in the first half of 2023, along with developed countries interested in its preservation. However, that and other efforts at elusive \"regional integration\" built on common ideology could face a closing window of opportunity. Castillo, ousted about a year and a half after his election, may not be the only leftist leader to face difficult times. Argentine President Alberto Fernandez is nursing an approval rating around 20% ahead of an October election in which he and his allies would face long odds - a reminder that this pink tide may soon, once again, be turning.

About six buses and 60 people became stranded in the Andean town of Checacupe, in Peru's Cusco region, in the early hours of Dec. 13, said Wilmaris Villarroel, a Costa Rican-Venezuelan alpinist whose bus was stopped en route to La Paz, Bolivia. The Dec. 7 ouster of former President Pedro Castillo has sparked deadly street protests across Peru, as well as highway and train blockades that have stranded hundreds of tourists at Peru's Machu Picchu ruins. Villarroel told Reuters that locals would not let the group, which she says includes elderly people and children, continue their journey. \"They said if we tried to pass they would burn us alive,\" Villarroel said, although Reuters was unable to verify the claim. Villarroel added that the buses' Bolivian drivers have been unwilling or unable to turn around, and that police presence has been minimal. Meanwhile, efforts to secure aid from foreign embassies in Peru have been unsuccessful, Villarroel said. In video shot by Villarroel and verified by Reuters, travelers from Argentina, Chile, France, Japan, England, Peru and the United States call for international assistance. \"We've been taken hostage in Peru,\" a French woman said in the video. Villarroel said the group has little cash and locals have resisted selling them food and water, leaving them hungry and dehydrated, with several falling ill as they are forced to sleep on buses with toilets that no longer function. \"We're not to blame for what's happening in the country,\" Willarroel told Reuters. \"It is a beautiful nation and we just want to continue our journey.\"","73":"SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - A heat wave that has hit Chile this week with record temperatures in some areas and a lack of rainfall has intensified forest fires that have already burned more than 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres)in the South American nation. Dozens of people have had to evacuate their homes because of the fires and the capital Santiago is under a public health alert due to a cloud of smoke, officials said on Friday. The state-owned National Forestry Corporation (Conaf) said firefighters were currently tackling 18 fires concentrated in the country's central regions, as well as a smaller number in the south. Among several localities in the Valparaiso region, around 40 homes have been evacuated and a dozen homes have been destroyed. Santiago, home to some six million people, woke on Friday to a haze of smoke as a result of a fire in the nearby rural town of Curacavi, where the blaze has devastated more than 1,700 hectares and 120 animals were being removed from the area. Local authorities issued a public health alert. \"What's being done is to monitor the fine and coarser particles to see how this may affect health,\" Santiago's government representative, Constanza Martinez, told reporters. Earlier this week, Chile's government said it was sending more resources to control the spread of wildfires. The capital recorded its highest temperature this year, 36.7 degrees Celsius (98.06°F) on Thursday, the third highest temperature the city has seen in 111 years, the official meteorology service reported. Miguel Munoz, metropolitan director of the National Emergency Office, told Reuters that because of the heat wave, \"not only are the fires increasing in intensity but also our Conaf firefighters have greater exposure to dehydration.\"","74":"SANTIAGO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - (This Dec. 12 story has been corrected to remove incorrect reference to the agreement being between the government and opposition lawmakers in the first paragraph) Chilean lawmakers on Monday announced an agreement to begin drafting a new constitution, three months after a referendum overwhelmingly rejected a progressive first text to replace a dictatorship-era charter. The agreement would see the new constitution drafted over next year by a body of 50 so-called constitutional advisors elected by direct vote, based on a preliminary draft prepared by a commission of 24 experts. It would be submitted for referendum in November or December next year, with mandatory public participation.

Under this agreement, the advisors would be elected in April and the half of the experts would be appointed by parliamentary deputies and the other half by senators.  read more  The agreement also proposed a parity between men and women, participation from indigenous peoples and that the proposals would need to be approved by three-fifths of the advisors.","75":"SANTIAGO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Chile is battling to control the spread of several wildfires that have already destroyed more than 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) of woodlands and are putting local communities at risk. Central regions including the Santiago metropolitan area, Valparaiso, O'Higgins and Maule are on red alert, with nine active fires currently being fought, data from the National Forestry Corporation (Conaf) showed on Monday. Members of the federal government met emergency agencies overnight to discuss firefighters' progress and the threat of new outbreaks. \"We have put in place all resources to fight the forest fires that are impacting the central areas of Chile,\" President Gabriel Boric said on Twitter on Sunday night. \"Our main concern is the safety of affected people, who are being helped, and the extinguishing of the fires that are still active,\" he added. As the fires edge closer, evacuations were ordered in Melipilla, some 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital, where school classes were suspended Monday. \"Residential areas have been threatened by fire and in many of those places, despite the risk factors, there has been resistance to following the guidelines to evacuate,\" said Minister of the Interior Carolina Toha. Forest fires are common around the southern summer season where high temperatures and strong winds help the rapid spread of flames. This season has registered 44 wildfire outbreaks throughout the country, according to official data.","76":"LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Global miner Anglo American Plc (AAL.L) on Friday cut its copper production estimates for 2023 because of deteriorating ore grades at its Chilean mines, and trimmed the higher-end of its output target for 2022. The London-listed miner expects its copper mines to produce between 840,000 and 930,000 tonnes in 2023 compared with a prior estimate of 910,000 tonnes to 1.02 million tonnes. In 2022, Anglo aims to produce between 650,000 and 660,000 tonnes of copper compared with the earlier guidance of 640,000 to 680,000 tonnes. The Quellaveco mine in Peru operated by Anglo began pilot production of copper concentrate last July. Anglo estimates it will produce around 300,000 tonnes a year for the first 10 years. The company also forecast a 3% drop in overall output this calendar year as the Quellaveco ramp-up and strong diamond output only partly made up for the lower output elsewhere. It said production should grow about 5% in 2023 from 2022. Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad told investors the company's focus in 2022 has been to restore normal operations after disruptions from COVID-19. Anglo mines platinum group metals and iron ore, and also produces copper and nickel crucial for electric vehicles. Wanblad said there would likely be a \"structural shortage\" of the materials needed to drive the world's energy transition, adding that permitting is the main factor holding up new mines. After returning record dividends to shareholders thanks to strong commodity prices in 2021, Anglo cut payouts in July as costs rose and production fell. High inflation, the prospect of a global recession and doubts about demand in China, the world's biggest user of raw materials, could hit earnings for Anglo and its peers. The company expects to spend $5 billion to $6.5 billion annually for the next three years and grow output until 2024, after which it predicts a levelling in 2025. Anglo said developing the Woodsmith fertiliser nutrients deposit in Britain's North York Moors National Park, would require an investment of $500 million in 2022 and $800 million next year. Besides lower grades and water shortage in Chile that would impact copper output, the company said production at its South African unit Kumba Iron Ore (KIOJ.J) will be dented by poor rail capacity. Poor performance at South African state logistics firm Transnet was exacerbated this year by a strike and a spike in copper cable theft. Inadequate freight rail services have cost exporters including Kumba millions of dollars.\n CEO Wanblad has said Anglo has been involved in talks with South Africa's government departments to improve Transnet's capacity. RBC Capital analysts said the challenges this year placed \"substantial pressure\" on the miner compared to its peers. \"This is...largely as a function of the higher rates of underlying growth, which makes operational missteps more noticeable and from some asset-specific challenges – like water in Chile or Transnet rail issues in South Africa,\" they said.","77":"VINA DEL MAR, Chile, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A goldsmith by trade, Angel Nieto carefully pries away a beehive from an inner-city tree in Chile's coastal Vina del Mar. Without a protective mask, he gently places the hive in a painted wooden box and carries it to a protected space he prepared in his garden earlier. Nieto decided this year to learn how to remove and transplant the beehives and honeycombs that appeared in the city as colonies reproduced over the Southern Hemisphere spring, in an attempt to help protect the key pollinating insect from residents who would likely destroy the hives. Chilean scientists have warned of declining bee populations, threatened by agricultural pesticides and the impacts of climate change. Across the Americas, extreme weather has devastated colonies, threatening harvests and pushing up food costs. In Chile, an extended drought that begun in 2010 has withered flowers and crops, wiping out food sources for the bees which pollinate many of the South American nation's main export crops, including avocados, blueberries, apples and almonds. \"It's about protecting them, taking care of them and the environment,\" said Nieto, who began volunteering to rescue beehives following a call from local firefighters. He said he collects the honey from the rescued colony for his family and also as a gift for neighbors and friends. \"In this space we prepare for them, they can be free, live peacefully, without any aggressive interventions,\" he added. \"Here they are not harmed.\"","78":"SANTIAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 11.25% on Tuesday, as the bank said the country had reached its peak in the current hiking cycle, which began in July 2021. The decision to maintain the rate was unanimous, the central bank noted and was expected by analysts and traders as the world's top copper producing nation struggles to rein in inflation. In a statement, the central bank said that monetary policy has made a \"significant adjustment\" and is helping imbalances in the economy. \"However, inflation continues to be very high and convergence to the 3% target is still subject to risks,\" the statement said. \"The Council will maintain the MPR at 11.25% until the state of the macroeconomy indicates that said process has been consolidated.\" In October, the agency stated that the MPR had reached the \"maximum level\" of the cycle and would remain at that level until it hit its target inflation rate. The bank made a series of aggressive rate hikes in an attempt to contain runaway inflation caused by a rapid economic recovery from COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There have been sign that inflation is receding in Chile, with 12-month inflation dropping to 12.8% in October from 14.1% in August. October's monthly inflation of 0.5% was below market expectations and the lowest in eight months. Despite this, 12-month inflation is still far above the central bank's target of 2% to 4%. On Wednesday, the central bank will publish updated macroeconomic projections for 2022 and 2023.","79":"SANTIAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Chile's government launched an investigation on Tuesday after raspberries from a Chilean company were recalled in the United States due to hepatitis A contamination. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing found the presence of hepatitis A in James Farm brand frozen raspberries from the South American country, a major exporter of raspberries, blueberries, grapes and cherries. \"The Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) has learned of these facts and has ordered an audit of the company,\" SAG Director Andrea Collado told Reuters, adding that the investigation could lead to a sanctions. According to the FDA, Exportadora Copramar was recalling 1,260 boxes of raspberries, which were packed in cardboard boxes branded James Farm and sold exclusively at Restaurant Depot\/Jetro locations in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. The company did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The FDA said there have been no reports of illnesses or adverse reactions related to the fruits. Chilean Minister of Agriculture Esteban Valenzuela called for calm while the case is being investigated. Valenzuela said that the regulations between the two countries would not stop raspberry exports, but that if problems were found with Copromar's shipments, actions would be \"limited to the company ...responsible.\"","80":"THE HAGUE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Judges at the World Court ruled on Thursday that Chile and land-locked Bolivia now agreed on previous points of dispute over access to the waters of the Silala river and that they would not need to make a decision on Chile's claims before the court. The judges urged the South American neighbours to work together on issues surrounding the frontier river, which runs through one of driest places on Earth, as such a \"shared resource can only be protected through cooperation\". Speaking to reporters from La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chilean President Gabriel Boric said the ruling gave Chile the legal certainty it was looking for. Boric said the ruling confirmed that the Silala river is an international watercourse governed by international law. \"Chile went to the court for judicial certainty and got it,\" Boric said. Bolivia's minister of foreign affairs, Rogelio Mayta, said the ruling gave Bolivia equitable and reasonable use of the Silala river. \"Today, the controversy over nature and use of the Silala river's waters has concluded,\" Mayta said in a statement. \"And from now on based on the ruling, Bolivia will exercise its rights it has over the waters of the Silala river.\" Chile had asked the court to rule that the Silala, which runs through the Atacama Desert, was an international waterway. Judges said on Thursday that during the hearings it became clear that the states did not fundamentally disagree on the designation of the river or the fact that Chile should have access to its waters. Bolivia and Chile cut off diplomatic ties decades ago over territorial disputes including Bolivia's calls for access to the sea. They have brought their long-running rivalry to The Hague court before. In 2018, the court ruled in Chile's favour in a case brought by Bolivia seeking that Chile enter into negotiations over granting Bolivia a corridor to the sea. The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, is the United Nations' court for resolving disputes between states.","81":"SANTIAGO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Workers at Chile's Escondida mine accepted a new offer from BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX) and will not move forward with a strike that had been planned for Monday and Wednesday, their union said Monday. Workers represented by the Sindicato No. 1 union at the Australian company's mine in northern Chile, the largest copper deposit in the world, had been threatening to strike over safety concerns. The union said that at 3:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) 1,495 members out of the 1,902 who voted accepted the company's new proposal. \"This proposal contains a series of concrete and verifiable measures to improve the hygiene and safety of workers,\" the union said in a statement. \"Especially an intense joint inspection program between the union and the company of all work areas.\" The union said the proposal also \"set aside changes in operating practices the company was pursuing.\" BHP had reached a deal with the union early last week, but the agreement was pending approval by some 2,000 workers represented by the union. Workers voted to reject the proposal on Thursday and threatened to strike if their demands weren't met. \"The assemblies together with the (union) board of directors decided to reject the company's proposal,\" the union said in a statement Thursday, adding that its members considered proposed security measures to be insufficient and wanted \"concrete and verifiable\" measures such as joint inspections of work areas. The company said in a statement that the proposal keeps initiatives that benefit both workers and the company. \"In addition, it includes a new 'Safety Plan' with concrete and collaborative actions that will strengthen the common efforts of the unions, joint committees and the company, which will begin to be implemented soon,\" the statement said. (This story has been corrected to fix first day of the strike to Monday instead of Tuesday)","82":"CARACAS\/BOGOTA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Colombia's government and leftist guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (ELN) said on Friday they have agreed to invite Brazil, Chile and Mexico as so-called guarantor countries in peace talks that seek to end nearly 60 years of conflict. The peace talks, which had been suspended in 2019, resumed in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Monday. Leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M-19 insurgency who took office in August, has promised to bring \"total peace\" to Colombia after the South American country signed a peace deal at the end of 2016 with the much larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Following a week of discussions, Colombia and the ELN said in a statement they have worked in an \"environment of trust and optimism.\" They agreed to bring in Brazil, Chile and Mexico to join Cuba, Norway and Venezuela, as countries who can ensure compliance with commitments made. They will also invite Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Spain to join and will encourage the United States to appoint a special envoy to the negotiating table. Colombia and the ELN also agreed to resume humanitarian relief, but did not offer details. Previous attempts at negotiations with the ELN, which has some 2,400 combatants and was founded in 1964 by radical Catholic priests, have not advanced partly because of dissent within its ranks. ELN leaders say the group is united, but it is unclear how much sway negotiators hold over active units. Much of the ELN's negotiating team is older than its rank and file. Talks between the ELN and the government of Juan Manuel Santos began in 2017 in Ecuador, later moving to Cuba, but were called off in 2019 by Santos' successor, Ivan Duque, because the ELN refused to halt hostilities and killed 22 police cadets in a bombing.","83":"Nov 18 (Reuters) - New Zealand's dairy exporter Fonterra Co-operative Group (FCG.NZ) said on Friday that it was selling its dairy operations in Chile to Peruvian firm Gloria Foods in multiple transactions worth about 591.07 billion Chilean pesos ($641.42 million). The divestment is part of Fonterra's renewed focus on bolstering its operations in New Zealand as it phases out its overseas milk pools, while reducing debt. The process to hive off its Chilean operations, Soprole, began in April this year and will be conducted through \"a number of transactions\" involving sale of shares in a Fonterra holding company, the dairy exporter said. \"Soprole is a very good business but does not rely on New Zealand milk or expertise,\" Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Miles Hurrell said in a statement. \"We are now at the end of the divestment process and have agreed to sell Soprole to Gloria Foods - JORB S.A. (Gloria Foods).\" Gloria confirmed the deal in a statement to Peru's securities regulator. The company said the transaction would involve $210 million in cash as well as an undisclosed amount of debt payments. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and commencement of a tender process in Chile for the outstanding shares in Soprole not already owned by Fonterra.

The huge 36-metre-diameter sinkhole that opened up in late July in the Tierra Amarilla commune, around 665 kilometers (413 miles) north of capital Santiago, drew widespread global attention and saw charges by authorities against Lundin. Studies to determine the causes of the sinkhole are already in \"decisive stages\" and a \"technical body is already receiving all the information to be able to draw conclusions,\" Luis Sanchez, president of a local unit of Lundin, told Reuters. The executive said that regardless of the outcome the firm planned to fill the hole using material such as sand and rocks with the same characteristics as a river bed, as well as fully sealing the affected part of the mine. Sanchez declined to predict the amount of material that would be needed or the total cost, though he said the firm had already spent some $10 million resolving the issue. The executive said that from 300-330 liters per second of water that had been leaking into the mine initially, the level has dropped to 10-30 liters per second due to sealing work. \"We are observing a positive development in the recovery of the levels in the aquifer and this means that we can look positively at this solution and we can say that we are not facing irreparable damage, as some authorities have indicated,\" Sanchez said. The program will also try to pump 1.3 million cubic meters of water that remains in the lower levels of the reservoir to other industrial users in the area in exchange for them stopping extracting those resources from the aquifer, Sanchez said.","85":"Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM, the world's second largest lithium producer, posted on Wednesday a ten-fold jump in third-quarter net profit, boosted by skyrocketing prices and record high sales of the metal that is a key component in rechargeable batteries. The miner posted a net profit of $1.1 billion for the three months ended September. Quarterly revenue surged more than four times year-on-year to $2.95 billion, with lithium revenues growing more than 12 times. Sales volumes for lithium and derivatives totaled 41,000 tonnes, the highest quarterly volume ever reported by the company, SQM said in its earnings report. \"Our positive results in the lithium market were due to sales volumes and prices significantly above average,\" the company said. SQM also sells industrial chemicals. Average lithium prices rose to record levels during the quarter at more than $56,000 per tonne, the company said. Major carmakers are planning to shift away from combustion engines over the next decade as they look to comply with more stringent environmental rules and changing consumer tastes, driving a scramble for lithium, which is extracted from brine in South America's sprawling salt flats. SQM forecast global lithium demand to grow this year by at least 40% due to rising electric vehicles sales in China, where it estimates sales of these vehicles to exceed 6.5 million units, double last year's amount. Revenues for iodine and its derivatives nearly doubled to reach $215 million, the company said, as sales rose 9%. Albemarle (ALB.N), the world's top lithium producer, also reported a surge in sales earlier this month. Both companies have major projects underway on Chile's Atacama salt flats.","86":"EL TENIENTE MINE, Chile, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A huge fully electric-powered 14-ton loading shovel has begun operating at Chile's century-old El Teniente copper mine, in what state miner Codelco (COBRE.UL) said on Wednesday was a first for South America. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, said the equipment the loader and hauler, developed by Swedish manufacturer Epiroc (EPIRa.ST) is the first 100% electric machinery of its kind to operate in the region. This comes as global leaders meet in Egypt for the COP 27 climate summit to discuss how to mitigate the harmful costs of rising fossil fuel emissions. The loader, which runs off rechargeable batteries, will be tested for a year in the key Chilean copper mine, while the company compares its performance with diesel-run machinery. \"We hope there will be more autonomy [with batteries] which can allow us to reach the levels of productivity achieved with conventional technology,\" Chief Executive Officer Andre Sougarret said during the project's launch. In one year, the new system is set save 433 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and 160,000 liters (42,267.53 U.S. gallons) of diesel consumption. It would also reduce noise and cut maintenance costs by some 60%. El Teniente, located in the highlands some 76 kilometers (47 miles) southeast of Chile's capital, produced 459,817 metric tons of copper last year. Halfway through this year, the site saw the introduction of a fleet of electric buses for workers, three years after the world's first hybrid cargo truck was launched there. Codelco plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030, as it looks to meet targets set by Chile's government in recent years. Leftist President Gabriel Boric has looked to toughening climate regulations, while investors grow ever more concerned by environmental precautions.","87":"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Five countries - Argentina, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Brazil and Chile - nominated candidates for president of the Inter-American Development Bank ahead of a Nov. 20 board election, the bank said on Saturday. Argentina had announced on Friday that it would nominate international economic relations Secretary Cecilia Todesca Bocco. Also previously nominated were Mexico's central bank Deputy Governor Gerardo Esquivel and Chile's former Finance Minister Nicolas Eyzaguirre. Brazil's outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro nominated former central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn, who heads the International Monetary Fund's Western Hemisphere department. Trinidad and Tobago nominated Gerard Johnson, a former IDB official now serving as a senior consultant to the Jamaican finance ministry, for the post. The deadline for submitting nominations was 11:59 p.m. on Friday, the IDB said. The IDB's governors, who are usually finance ministers or other high-ranking economic authorities from the Bank’s 48 member countries, will interview the candidates at a virtual meeting on Nov. 13, with the election to follow at a hybrid meeting a week later, it said. An aide to Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is seeking to delay the election until next year so that Brazil's nomination can reflect the newly elected leader. read more  Former Finance Minister Guido Mantega said he sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to support a delay. A Treasury spokesperson said Washington was not in favor. \"The rules for elections are clear and we expect the elections to occur on the agreed timeline. The nominations period just closed and the U.S. is carefully assessing each candidate,\" the spokesperson said. The U.S. Treasury, which did not nominate any candidate for the leadership role, holds 30% voting power in the bank, followed by Brazil (11%) and Argentina (11%). Colombia and Chile each hold a 3% stake. Former President Mauricio Claver-Carone, the first American to hold the job, was ousted in an ethics scandal last month.","88":"SANTIAGO, Nov 10(Reuters) - Chile's President Gabriel Boric condemned \"terrorist\" violence during a visit to the country's restive southern region on Thursday, a rhetorical shift for the leader who had pledged to focus on dialogue with indigenous local Mapuche groups and eschew former President Sebastian Pinera's militarization of the region. Several arson attacks and blockades took place early Thursday morning ahead of his visit to the Araucania region, where Mapuche groups have been demanding the return of ancestral lands for years. Trucks and trains have been attacked. \"If they think they are going to intimidate me or this government, they are very wrong,\" Boric said during a press conference, referring to \"acts of a terrorist nature\". During the young left-wing president's first week in office this year, his then interior minister saw her visit to the region interrupted by gunfire. Boric later reinstated a state of emergency, keeping a strong military presence in the region. Boric compared Thursday's arson attacks, which included a school and a church, to Nazis burning synagogues in the 1930s and the Chilean military dictatorship burning books in 1973. During the speech, Boric announced that the government would create two support centers for victims of violence in the region. He said the government would also increase surveillance on major transport routes and focus on combating wood theft, arms control and improving food security. \"We haven't been capable as a state to solve the lag in terms of poverty,\" Boric said. \"And we haven't found a path that's lasted to find peace.\"","89":"SANTIAGO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Chile's inflation in October slowed to its lowest level in eight months, official data showed on Tuesday, a positive surprise likely to reinforce the central bank's take that its aggressive monetary tightening cycle has come to an end. Consumer prices in the Andean nation rose 0.5% in October, government statistics agency INE said, slowing down from the 0.9% reported in the previous month and below an expected 0.91% in a Reuters poll of economists. The lowest monthly figure since February took Chile's 12-month rate of consumer price increases to 12.8%, still far above the central bank's target range of 2% to 4% but also below the 13.7% seen in September. The data comes after Chile's central bank signaled last month that no more interest rate hikes were expected ahead, but that it would keep rates at the current level for as long as needed to ensure inflation would converge to target. Chile, the world's largest copper producer, went through an aggressive monetary tightening cycle to bring down high inflation that followed its economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including a 50 basis-point hike last month to 11.25%. According to INE, inflation last month was boosted mainly by higher food and non-alcoholic beverage prices, as well as transportation costs. Eight of the twelve groups surveyed posted higher prices in the period, the agency said. \"This is a good report, with the headline inflation rate showing clear evidence of a downtrend,\" said Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that it comes as a relief for the local central bank. Abadia said inflation likely will continue to fall over the first half of next year due to the effect of tight financial conditions, but noted rates are expected to be maintained at their current level for the foreseeable future. Scotiabank's Chile senior economist Anibal Alarcon, on the other hand, said he already forecasts an aggressive rate cut of between 100 and 200 basis points in January 2023 after October's \"true disinflationary surprise\". \"We expect the market to align with our view very quickly with significant falls in nominal rates,\" Alarcon added.","90":"SANTIAGO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The largest pilots union of Latam Airlines (LTM.SN) in Chile voted to strike on Wednesday, a day before the company said it was planning on concluding its exit from bankruptcy. The Union of Latam Pilots (SPL) said it represents 313 of Latam Airlines's approximately 500 pilots and that 99% of its members voted to approve the strike. In a statement released Wednesday, the union said it was looking to revert some pandemic-era cost-saving measures, including a 30% pay cut and a shift to \"variable salary model.\" \"What we're asking now is an act of justice that jumps into view: recover conditions we had before the adjustment that hit us hard,\" Mario Troncoso, president of the SPL said in a statement. Troncoso added that 240 pilots were fired during the pandemic and while company executives and other company employees recovered 100% of their pre-pandemic salaries, pilots are the only ones still receiving a reduced salary. The statement said that the company's proposal to link pre-pandemic salary to flight hours is unfeasible and could be reached, at best, three months out of the year. Latam Airlines refused to comment publicly on the matter. While pilots voted to strike, Chilean law establishes up to four days in which either party can request mediation from the country's labor department. Strikes must be suspended during the mediation process.","91":"SANTIAGO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Mining giants BHP (BHP.AX) and Antofagasta Minerals said on Wednesday that a mining royalty bill in Chile would affect competitiveness and encourage miners to reevaluate investments. Chile is the world's top copper producing nation and the government has proposed a royalty with a portion based on sales and the other subject to profitability, which progresses as the price of copper increases. Speaking to Chile's Congress, BHP's vice president of corporate affairs for the Americas, Rene Muga, said the current bill would impact the company's competitiveness abroad and negatively impact its own operations in other countries. \"It is our duty to warn that in a highly competitive global world, Chile cannot disproportionately increase its taxes without significantly affecting investment levels,\" Muga said. He added that the initiative would lead the mining company to reconsider an announced investment portfolio of $10 billion, since it was designed \"without considering such an excessive tax burden increase.\" For his part, the vice president of corporate affairs of Antofagasta Minerals (ANTO.L) , Rene Aguilar, pointed out that with the proposed changes, total taxation would exceed 48%, putting it on par with high-tax countries such as Congo, Mongolia and Zambia. \"It is essential to consider the depreciation of investments in the calculation of mining income,\" Aguilar said. \"This is a very relevant point, especially for groups like Antofagasta, which has a potential investment portfolio of close to $5 billion for the coming years.\" Both company representatives acknowledged that there's room for more contribution from the mining sector, but pushed for collaborative agreements that maintain business sustainability. Other global mining giants like state-owned Codelco, Glencore (GLEN.L), Anglo American (AAL.L) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) also operate in Chile.","92":"LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Schools in Scotland, Uganda, Chile, Philippines and the United States triumphed at the inaugural \"World’s Best School Prizes\" on Wednesday for feats including saving mangroves and expanding classrooms in an area hit by war. The five schools shared $250,000 in prize money for supporting pupils and communities, especially during the pandemic, in the awards organised by global body T4 Education. Dunoon Grammar School in Scotland won the category of community collaboration for skill-based courses, including in travel and tourism, design and maritime studies, intended to stem a brain-drain. Escuela Emilia Lascar in Penaflor, Chile won for innovation for its \"Emilia TV\" programme which addressed issues from mental health to gender identity. Bonuan Buquig National High School in Dagupan City, Philippines took the environmental prize for helping rehabilitate lost mangroves and provide new habitats for fish. From two classrooms to schooling 450 pupils, Project Shelter Wakadogo in north Uganda won the prize for overcoming adversity after locals secured land, levelled roads and planted vegetables for school meals in an area that suffered from civil war. Curie Metropolitan High School in Chicago, Illinois, won the supporting healthy lives prize for providing an arts programme for students, many from minorities, as well as integrated health services. “Far too many children will continue to be left behind in the wake of COVID unless governments take urgent action to tackle the education crisis,\" T4 Education and the prizes founder Vikas Pota said in a statement. \"As a first step, they must turn to the knowledge and experience contained within our schools because those on the frontlines of education know better than anyone else the change we need to see.\" Founded during the pandemic, T4 brings together teachers from around to world via a digital platform providing tools and initiatives for education.","93":"SANTIAGO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Scattered clashes around Chile between protesters and police on Tuesday marked the third anniversary of widespread protests against inequality in 2019 that left more than 30 people dead. In the capital of Santiago, hooded protesters lit fires and threw rocks at police, including in the area surrounding Plaza Baquedano, the epicenter of the 2019 riots, while police responded with gas and water cannons. Other peaceful protesters gathered around the capital to remember victims. \"Perhaps there were people who did evil, destruction, but there are many of us who were - and are - asking for justice, dignity,\" said Marco Valdebenito, 49, whose brother died during the protests in 2020. \"Those of us who fought are here.\" Speaking from La Moneda palace Tuesday morning, leftist President Gabriel Boric, who took office this year and supported the 2019 protests as a legislator, said there was an opportunity to build the foundations of a less unequal society. \"The social unrest expressed - and brought - a lot of pain and has left huge consequences,\" Boric said. \"We will not allow it to be in vain, we cannot be the same as a society after this experience, we cannot make the same mistakes.\" Several human groups organizations have questioned the police response during the protests, which left hundreds of protesters blinded by rubber bullets and tens of thousands of people detained. \"To be clear, human rights violations like ocular injuries, sexual assaults, grave injuries, even deaths, are unacceptable,\" Boric said, adding that the police have the government's \"full support to fight crime and assure public order.\" The protests that erupted in 2019 died down with an agreement to draft a new constitution and the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by voters last month, forcing the government back to the drawing board as voters continue to demand change amid a struggling economy.","94":"SANTIAGO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Chilean authorities will beef up security on trains carrying cargoes of copper, a senior official said on Thursday, after a spate of violent heists that have been blamed on international organized crime gangs. FCAB, a major mining railway operator, suspended the transport of copper earlier this week following a series of attacks and thefts, forcing mines in the world's top copper producer to look for other transport routes.  read more  Chile's interior deputy secretary Manuel Monsalve announced on Thursday new measures to strengthen train security after meeting with the general manager of FCAB, the train freight arm of Chile-focused miner Antofagasta Plc (ANTO.L). \"Starting today, Carabineros (police force) will have specialized personnel to safeguard journeys that are considered high risk or more vulnerable,\" Monsalve told reporters in the northern mining city of Antofagasta. Monsalve said there would also be air support to provide security and improved communication to flag any threats. \"We're not just interested in improving safety conditions,\" Monsalve said. \"We want to identify and stop the criminal organizations behind these kinds of crimes.\" Long a beacon of stability in Latin America, Chile in recent years has seen a jump in organized crime, apparently related to the drug trade. FCAB said it had resumed shipments of copper cathodes on Thursday on the basis of the new protections. State miner Codelco and BHP Group (BHP.AX) have both recently said they were assessing transport options due to the train heists. Denis Varas, president of the National Union of FCAB Workers, said there had been about 70 train robberies in the last three years and that they have become bolder and increasingly violent. \"The robbers are coming in armed, in off-road vehicles, with a system to attack a train, detain the operator, kidnap them, beat them,\" Varas told Reuters this week. Varas said robbers sometimes even use cranes and can steal up to 20 tonnes of copper at a time. He said that robbers in recent attacks appeared to have detailed information on the railway. \"They know our operation so well that they know the areas that are most isolated, where we lose radio contact,\" Varas said. Varas said the union would monitor the new security measures and stop shipments again if workers felt unsafe. Mario Carrera, a regional prosecutor in the northern region of Arica y Parinacota, told reporters that the gangs were looking to take the copper overseas. \"We're evidently in the presence of organized crime,\" he said. \"In this (recent) case the copper was going to Peru, we think that after that, based on what we've investigated, it would go to Asia, China, Korea or other countries.\"","95":"LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Chile's Codelco, the world's biggest copper miner, is offering to sell copper to European buyers at a record high premium around $235 a tonne for 2023, a rise of 85% from 2022, two sources familiar with the matter said. The premiums set by state-owned Codelco for physical delivery of copper, paid on top of the London Metal Exchange contract , are seen as a benchmark for global contracts. Codelco in London declined to comment. \"Many European consumers don't want Russian copper, they have to look elsewhere,\" one of the sources said. \"The copper market is tight and self-sanctioning is making for tricky negotiations in Europe.\" Industry sources say consumers shunning metal from Russia is part of the reason for the boost in demand for metal from other sources. Russia in 2021 supplied the European Union with nearly 292,000 tonnes of copper, according to data from Trade Data Monitor, which showed EU copper imports totalling more than 801,000 tonnes last year. Europe's biggest copper smelter Aurubis (NAFG.DE) will charge its European customers a premium of $228 per tonne above the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME) price in 2023, the company said on Thursday. That is sharply up from a premium of $123 a tonne in 2022. Montanwerke Brixlegg is offering customers a 295 euro per tonne premium for its low carbon copper for next year and a floating surcharge for high energy costs, a letter from the Austrian company to its customers showed last month.","96":"SANTIAGO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chile's congress voted to approve the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade deal on Tuesday after four years of legislative debate. Twenty-seven senators voted for the world's largest copper producer to join the 11-country trade deal while 10 voted against and one senator abstained. The government had said the CPTPP was not part of its program and it would not promote or hinder its passage. The trade deal had become a source of political debate, and protesters against the CPTPP gathered outside the Senate building on Tuesday to oppose the deal. As of Tuesday, the agreement can be enacted by President Gabriel Boric, but it will be delayed because the president sent a series of side letters to 10 member countries that could extend the process. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary for International Economic Relations told Reuters the side letters aim \"to modify elements of the chapter referring to investor-State dispute resolution mechanisms, a subject of criticism and international debate.\" The president's press office said the government's line is to move forward with the side letters. The CPTPP is comprised of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The United States formally withdrew in 2017 under President Donald Trump. The agreement withdraws 95% of the tariffs among its members and, according to the Chilean Foreign Ministry website, is one of the most relevant economic integration schemes in Asia Pacific, covering 498 million people who represent 12% of the global economy.","97":"SANTIAGO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Chilean miners including state-owned Codelco will evaluate transportation alternatives after a key railway suspended transport of a major copper product due to growing theft in the country's main mining region, the state firm said on Tuesday. Chile is the world's top copper producer but a recent wave of robberies have undermined the logistics of bringing the valuable red metal to market. Global BHP Group (BHP.AX), another major miner with operations in the South American country, said it is also assessing its transport options, according to a statement issued last week. The FCAB railway arm of Chile's Antofagasta Group (ANTO.L) announced last weekend an indefinite suspension of the transport of so-called cathodes, copper sheets used to make a wide variety of goods, due to robberies mostly targeting lines in the country's northern region. Codelco is implementing a plan to ensure the continuity of transportation for its products, the company said in a brief statement sent to Reuters. FCAB added the suspension will continue until significant security improvements are implemented. Chile mostly produces copper concentrates, but a quarter of its output last year was represented by cathodes. In June, the government launched a plan to boost police presence and surveillance in the north, a sparsely populated area that is also home to the bone-dry Atacama Desert. Chile's key mining sector called on the government in mid-August to take more action to stop what it then described as an \"escalation\" of criminal activity.  read more ","98":"UNITED NATIONS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday elected South Africa, Algeria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Morocco, Romania and Vietnam to the Human Rights Council for a three-year term starting on Jan. 1, 2023. Germany and Sudan also won second terms on the Geneva-based body, but South Korea and Venezuela failed to be re-elected. The 47-member council cannot make legally binding decisions, but its decisions carry political weight and it can authorize inquiries. \"It’s a mixed picture. Korea being out is quite a negative surprise but liberal democracies will be relieved that Venezuela is out,\" said Olaf Wientzek, director of the Geneva office of Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Candidates are elected in geographical groups. There were two competitive races on Tuesday - among the Asia-Pacific and Latin American & Caribbean states - to elect 14 members. Members cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Along with South Korea and Venezuela, Afghanistan also failed to win a seat. Observers said the election was important since it could tip the power balance within a deeply divided council. Vote counts have been getting closer on key issues, and last week a Western-led coalition lost a call for a debate on accusations of Chinese abuses in Xinjiang by just two votes in an historic defeat. Investigations mandated by the Human Rights Council are sometimes later used before national and international courts, such as such as in the case of a former Syrian intelligence officer jailed for state-backed torture in Germany in January.","99":"SANTIAGO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Chile's mining minister announced on Friday the permanent closure of mining stopes directly related to a giant sinkhole that appeared in the northern part of the country in July.

The minister added that the government is working on recovering water from an aquifer that was damaged by the sinkhole. \"We're interested in recovering 1.3 million cubic meters of water that are currently stagnant in the depth,\" Hernando said. \"Our intention is to return them to the aquifer, for which we're studying multiple alternatives.\" Chile's SMA environmental regulator announced the charges against the Canadian-owned Lundin Mining Corp's (LUN.TO) copper mine on Thursday for the sinkhole.  read more  SMA filed a charge labeled as \"very serious\" for \"irreparable environmental damage\" to the aquifer, in addition to a \"serious\" charge for overextraction and two minor ones related to transporting minerals.

The Chilean currency is threatening to breach the 1,000 peso per dollar line once again after it hit a record low near 1,050 pesos in July. That milestone led the central bank to launch a plan to sell $20 billion in dollars and FX hedging instruments, backed up by a $5 billion currency swap and peso liquidity program. That move successfully helped cull wild volatility. However, as the U.S. dollar soars and interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve hammer global currencies from the British sterling to the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan, the impact of Chile's intervention has faded. In the last two months the currency has weakened some 6.5% versus the dollar, trailing major regional currencies in Brazil, Mexico, Peru and Colombia. It is likely to weaken more after the central bank ended its intervention program on Sept. 30. \"Probably in the short term, maybe in October we'll see 1,000 pesos (to the dollar) and maybe we'll beat our historic low,\" said Angel Rubilar, a Santiago-based senior analyst at Libertex. The currency is now worth 968 per dollar. Chile is not alone in having to defend its currency. FX interventions have increased in India, the Philippines and Korea in recent weeks, while Japan's central bank spent a record 2.8 trillion yen ($19.7 billion) in the FX market last week. That intervention, following the yen's slump to a 24-year low of nearly 146 to the dollar, triggered a sharp bounce of more than 5 yen per dollar, although the currency has drifted down again to around 144.7. Diego Mora, a market strategist for XTB Latam, said that Chile's central bank intervention had helped reduce the chances of aggressive currency moves, but had its limits. \"The intervention was successful for what the central bank needed, which was controlling volatility in the exchange rate, but not the price,\" said Mora, noting that markets were already pricing in the end of the intervention next week. \"The possibility of a sharp crash is lower.\" Chile, the world's top producer of copper and the No. 2 for electric vehicle battery metal lithium, is also grappling with annual inflation at some 14%, weakening copper prices and a predicted recession, compounding the hit from the strong dollar. Currency strategist Juan Prada at Barclays said the tightening of global financial conditions was ramping up pressure on some regional markets particularly susceptible to external global economic impacts. \"We have identified Chile and Colombia as vulnerable, and COP (Colombian peso) and CLP (Chilean peso) have underperformed LatAm peers\" since the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting in September, he said. Chile's central bank, however, has given no indication that it would intervene again. Analysts and traders say that despite pressures, another intervention would be \"hasty\" and could risk longer-term stability by denting levels of reserves. \"Reserves aren't infinite,\" Mora added. \"If the central bank has less direct reserves of foreign currency, the country becomes riskier with its long-term interest rates.\"","102":"Sept 30 (Reuters) - Several fans were injured after a section of Santiago's Estadio Monumental collapsed on Friday during an open training session hosted by Chilean club Colo Colo. Footage on social media showed hundreds of cheering supporters in the stand before it gave way under their weight. \"We regret the events that took place today... where a group of people did not respect the minimum standards of behaviour by climbing onto a structure for advertising, over which they jumped and caused part of it to collapse,\" Colo Colo said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, some of those involved were injured and were taken to the nearest medical centre.\" The club did not specify how many people had been injured. Colo Colo added that they would completely remove the damaged structure to avoid a similar accident in the future. \"We confirm our commitment and willingness to the authorities to continue making all necessary improvements to ensure the safety of our fans.\" Colo Colo's open practice, known as the \"Arengazo\", is a club tradition where fans get to cheer their team inside the stadium ahead of important games.

World governing body FIFA earlier this month dismissed an appeal in the case of Ecuadorean player Byron Castillo, who Chile had alleged was ineligible to play in qualifying since he was born in Colombia. Castillo played in eight of Ecuador's qualifying games - including twice against Chile - for the Qatar World Cup as they took fourth place, while Chile finished seventh. Ecuador have denied that the player was ineligible. CAS said it had also accepted an appeal by the Peruvian football federation (FPF). Fifth-placed Peru missed out on the last automatic spot but advanced to the inter-confederation playoffs, where they lost to Australia. \"The appeal filed by the FPF is directed at the Ecuador football association (FEF) and FIFA. The FPF requests that Ecuador be excluded from the FIFA World Cup 2022 and replaced by Peru, which is the best runner-up,\" CAS said in a statement. \"(Chile's) FFCH requests CAS to rule that the Player was ineligible for the 8 matches played in the Qualifiers, declaring those matches as forfeited and placing Chile in the 4th position in the South America 2022 World Cup Qualifiers.\" A decision is expected by Nov. 10, days before the World Cup kicks off on Nov. 20 with Ecuador scheduled to take on hosts Qatar.","104":"SANTIAGO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Chile authorities on Wednesday were scouring an arid mountainous region of the country in a search for British astronomer Thomas Marsh who disappeared more than 10 days ago from an observatory in northern Chile where he was on a research visit. The local prosecutor's office, police, emergency services and the military are searching for the 60-year-old University of Warwick researcher around the La Silla observatory, located in a mountainous area some 600 kilometers (373 miles) north of the Chilean capital Santiago. Marsh went missing on Sept. 16. The search, supported by drones, aerial surveillance systems and ground teams with dogs to cover an area of more than 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres), has so far failed to find the astronomer, though local authorities held out hope that he could be found alive. \"There are no indications that he is dead,\" the press office of the prosecutor's office in the Coquimbo region, where the facility run by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is located, told Reuters on Wednesday. Police reported that Marsh's keys were found on the way from the residences to the telescopes, and that his room, with all his belongings, was untouched. Marsh traveled to the observatory with a doctoral student from Warwick. Local press said the student provided a statement to investigators but the prosecutor's office declined to confirm or deny that. Last week in a statement reporting the disappearance and giving the astronomer's physical characteristics, ESO asked that any information be passed on to the police in Chile or the United Kingdom. The organization has not received any new information since. The scientist's family, who have asked for help through social media to find him, are expected to arrive in Chile in the next few hours, according to local press reports. The La Silla observatory is located on the southern edge of the Atacama Desert, about 2,400 meters (7,874 feet) above sea level. Northern Chile is a global hub for astronomical observation due to the quality of its skies.","105":"NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Chile estimates it will issue $12 billion in total debt next year and the largest budget increases will be in social protection and science and technology, Finance Minister Mario Marcel told Reuters on Thursday. \"So we're cutting (issuance) by half, reflecting the fact that we will have an overall balance that will be considerably stronger than what people thought we would have,\" said Marcel, adding most of it will be to refinance maturing issues. The minister is confident Chile will soon make a dent on inflation, running at double digits. \"We're particularly confident in terms of curbing inflation earlier than other countries,\" he said, citing an early and consistent monetary policy tightening that began in mid-July 2021. The Chilean peso has been pressured like many other currencies by the dollar strength, breaching the 1,000 pesos per dollar mark for the first time last July. It currently sits at 944 pesos per greenback, down nearly 10% so far this year. Marcel said between 100 and 150 pesos in the exchange are due to an uncertainty premium he says shot up in late 2019 when Chileans took to the streets in what were the largest social protests in decades. The COVID-19 pandemic and a string of votes in Chile, including a referendum that rejected a new constitution that would have sharply expanded social benefits, helped keep uncertainty high. Marcel said clear signals for another moderate constitutional proposal, progress on tax reforms and hopeful pension reforms will help reduce uncertainty. The pension reform is expected to be presented to Congress in a matter of weeks, aiming among other things to expand the basic benefit by some 30% and increase contributions from employers by 6%. \"Pension reform should cost in the longer run something between 4% and 5% of (gross domestic product),\" Marcel said. \"It should take at least six years to face-in all this increase so as not to have an impact on employment.\"","106":"Sept 16 (Reuters) - A diplomatic tussle intensified on Friday after Chile's president put off accepting the credentials of Israel's new ambassador to Santiago over the killing in the occupied West Bank of a Palestinian teenager. In response, Israel's Foreign Ministry summoned Chilean ambassador Jorge Carvajal for what it called a reprimand at a meeting where, it said, \"Israel’s response will be made clear.” The dispute began on Thursday when Chilean Foreign Minister Antonia Urrejola informed newly appointed Israeli Ambassador Gil Artzyeli that Chilean President Gabriel Boric was postponing a meeting to accept his credentials until October. \"That’s because today is a sensitive day because of the death of a minor,\" a spokesperson from Chile's ministry of foreign affairs said in a text message, referring to the death of the 17-year-old Palestinian boy that day.  read more  Israel assailed the snub on Friday, with its Foreign Ministry labeling it \"puzzling and unprecedented behaviour\" and adding in its statement: \"This seriously harms the relations between the two countries.\" On Thursday, Artzyeli, the new ambassador, sought to ease tensions following what he said was an \"extensive\" meeting where Chilean authorities repeatedly apologized. \"Being an Israeli and a Jew my people have seen worse things in the last 4,000 years,\" he told reporters in Santiago. \"We're going to overcome this incident for the good of Chile, the good of Israel and our bilateral relations.\" Separately on Friday, Boric's move drew praise from the Palestinian Authority, as well as the Islamist Hamas movement in Gaza. \"We welcome the Chilean president's position, which is in line with international law and resolutions, and we appreciate this position aimed at applying pressure on the Israeli government to stop its ongoing daily crimes against our people,\" said Ahmad al-Deek, adviser to the Palestinian foreign minister.

FIFA Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes.\" The Chilean Football Federation confirmed it would appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). \"This is a dark day for football and for the credibility of the system... Of course, we will refer this to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" Jorge Yunge, general secretary of the Chilean Football Federation, said. \"The weight of evidence is clear and we urge the Appeal Committee to deliver the grounds of the decision very quickly because there were enough unjustifiable delays and postponements in this case.\" The Chilean Football Federation's lawyer Eduardo Carlezzo said they had a \"huge number of documents\" that proved \"without any reasonable doubt that the player was born in Colombia\". \"I have never seen in my entire life as a lawyer an injustice like this one,\" Carlezzo said. \"Sad day for football and for fair play. The message is clear: cheating is allowed. We will appeal to CAS.\" Chile appealed the decision on July 1 and recently urged FIFA to speed up the process before they were assigned a hearing on Thursday.

In a video that went viral Monday, a glacier that sits atop a mountain about 200 meters (656 feet) high rumbled and broke off at Queulat National Park, located more than 1,200 kilometers(746 miles) south of Chile's capital. Detachments between masses of ice are normal, says University of Santiago climate scientist Raul Cordero, but he noted that the frequency of these events is troubling. \"Because this type of event is triggered by heat waves or by intense liquid precipitation events and both things are also happening more and more frequently throughout the planet, not only in Chile,\" Cordero said. According to Cordero, there was a heat wave with \"very abnormal\" temperatures in that area of Patagonia before the collapse. Cordero added that an \"atmospheric river\" consisting of relatively warm air laden with moisture was also recorded. When this \"river meets with Andean and Patagonian topography, it forms large clouds and discharges precipitation. \"One of the consequences of global warming is that it is destabilizing several glaciers and in particular some unstable glacier walls,\" said Cordero. \"That is the case of what happened in the last few days in Patagonia in a similar way to what happened a couple of months ago in both the Himalayas and the Alps.\" Scientists say sharp spikes in warming is linked to human-caused climate change and greenhouse emissions.

Maria Rivas, an engineer originally from Venezuela, said the proposal failed because it was \"created in anger, under strong tensions and divisions and was not good for Chile.\" The process was also flooded with misinformation about the new constitution, a factor some voters think impacted the vote so heavily.  read more  “If people had informed themselves better, if they had believed less in lies, the outcome would have been different,\" said Susana Lobos, who works in advertising. \"But they believed in the social media, in lies they heard and they were scared, believing Chile could turn into Venezuela.” The vote had been seen as something of a referendum also on 36-year-old Boric, who came into office in March promising economic and social reforms, though has been hit by high inflation levels, economic worries and a weak peso currency. Chile's markets rallied on Monday as investors cheered the result, which some said will force any new constitution text to be more moderate and to involve more centrist and conservative groups in its redrafting. Boric, who led a broad leftist alliance when winning election, said on Sunday night that he was planning to reshape his cabinet in the wake of the defeat, which could also see him bring in more moderate ministers. In a press conference Monday afternoon, Camila Vallejo, the government's spokesperson, said that regardless of the result, Sunday's vote was going to mark a new phase for the government. \"When the president considers adjustments, he's doing it for the good of the country and we all have to be available to step aside if that's what the president wants,\" Vallejo said. Center-left and right-wing politicians that opposed the new constitution have expressed interest in working with the government to draft a new text, while others have suggested amending the current constitution through Congress.","116":"SANTIAGO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Chileans overwhelmingly voted against a proposed new constitution on Sunday, rejecting what would have been one of the world's most progressive charters. While nearly 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020, nearly 62% of voters rejected the new text with 99.74 percent of ballot boxes counted. Karol Cariola, spokeswoman for the approval campaign, conceded defeat late on Sunday night in downtown Santiago but said the mandate to draft a new text remains in force. \"We are committed to creating conditions to channel that popular will and the path that leads us to a new constitution,\" Cariola said. President Gabriel Boric, whose government is largely tied to the new text, said cabinet changes were coming and the government would work to draft another constitution. \"We have to listen to the voice of the people. Not just today, but the last intense years we've lived through,\" Boric said. \"That anger is latent, and we can't ignore it.\" The president said he would work with congress and different sectors of society to draft another text with lessons from Sunday's rejection. Center-left and right wing parties that promoted the reject campaign, have also agreed to negotiate to prepare a new text. \"I think there are two things that explain what has just happened. One is a rejection of the Boric government,\" political analyst Cristobal Bellolio told Reuters, adding that the other was identity politics in regards to indigenous and other issues. The proposed text that voters rejected was a response to widespread violent protests that gripped the nation in late 2019 and focused on social rights, the environment, gender parity and indigenous rights, a sharp shift from its market-friendly constitution dating back to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.  read more  Nearly 13 million of 15 million Chileans and residents who were eligible to vote cast ballots across more than 3,000 voting centers. These included the national stadium in Santiago, where Rosemarie Williamson, 54, and her mother, 85, voted to reject the new constitution. Williamson, who had voted 'yes' in 2020, cited worries over several proposals. \"The main one is (indigenous) plurinationality and then pension funds,\" she said. \"I've worked my whole life and I'm not willing to share that.\" Diego Uribe, 35, a father of two who does not normally vote because he has lost faith in political parties, voted 'yes' in Puente Alto, a lower-income region in southern Santiago. \"This one is different,\" Uribe said, noting he would have voted even if it was not mandatory. \"Approval is real change for the future, free education, dignified healthcare and more rights.\" The latest polls before a two-week blackout showed rejectors ahead at 47%, compared with 38% for 'yes' and 17% undecided, but Sundays result beat polls by wide margin.","117":"SANTIAGO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Chileans will head to the polls on Sunday to approve or reject a new constitution that would replace the Andean country's current text that dates back decades to the era of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.  read more  The proposed new constitution focuses on social rights, the environment and gender equality, a sharp shift from the market-orientated current one that underpinned decades of growth but that stoked inequalities that led to months of angry protests in 2019. The new text, if approved, would set the stage for stronger environmental protections in the world's top producer of copper and No. 2 producer of battery metal lithium, which has stoked some concern in the mining sector. Uncertainties have also rattled markets and investors, though that is unlikely to subside regardless of the result given the likelihood a new process if the current text fails. \"Even if rejection wins, institutional uncertainty is to linger,\" investment bank J.P. Morgan said in a note. The most recent polls since April have show more voters plan to reject the new constitution than approve it, with a consistent lead of about 10 points over the last month of polling. Pollsters are currently in a black-out period. More than 15 million Chileans and residents are eligible to participate in the mandatory vote on Sunday, casting ballots at some 3,000 sites around the country. Polls open at 8 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) and close at 6 p.m., unless there are voters still in line. Results are expected within a few hours. If the text is approved, the ruling coalition has signed a pact to reform and \"clarify\" some areas of the constitution. There are also 57 transitory articles that will guide the transition from the current constitution. If the text is rejected, President Gabriel Boric has said a new constitutional process must be initiated to comply with a 2020 referendum where 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution to replace the Pinochet-era text. Other political factions say the current text can be more simply amended using the quorum adjustments that have been recently approved.","118":"SANTIAGO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Chileans are set for a historic decision on Sunday: stick with a market-friendly constitution dating back to military dictator Augusto Pinochet or approve a progressive new text that promises to shake up the Andean country's political and social fabric. The copper-rich country is sharply divided, with polls indicating that the new text will get rejected, despite huge popular support for tearing up the Pinochet-era constitution two years ago in the wake of months of fiery protests against inequality. The vote is a crossroads for Chile, long seen as a bastion of conservatism and market-orientated economic policy, which underpinned decades of growth and stability that also created stark inequality between rich and poor. \"This is about settling a historical debt in Chile, because despite economic growth and lower poverty, we have outstanding debts to do with inequality and social welfare,\" said Vlado Mirosevic, spokesperson for the approve campaign. Mirosevic said the new constitution was key to overturning decades of inequality and put progressive rights and the environment at the heart of the country's social fabric. Nearly 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in October 2020. An elected 155-member assembly, consisting of mostly independent and progressive constituents, then began drafting it the following May, completing it earlier this year. But enthusiasm has waned as Chile's economy has felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiraling inflation and the currency hitting historic lows. That's hurt support for the constitution and its backer, progressive President Gabriel Boric. Polls indicate the reject camp holding a near 10 percentage point lead of around 46% to 37%, according to the most recent surveys. Some 17% remain undecided. Ximena Rincon, a conservative senator campaigning against the new constitution, said people had lost faith in the assembly responsible for drafting the text. Lots of uncertainty and disinformation has bogged down the constitution also. \"The assembly wasn't representative of society,\" she said, calling for a smaller, more representative assembly to be elected if the new constitution was rejected on Sunday. Kenneth Bunker, a political analyst, said Sunday's vote might also act as a referendum on Boric, a young former student protest leader who took office in March and has supported the new constitution. \"There will be people who see the price of gasoline and food, and blame the government over the economy and say that they're the same ones who made the constitution, and so decide 'I vote no',\" Bunker said. Unpredictability remains, however, given the number of undecided voters and a mandatory vote as opposed to previous elections where voting was voluntary. \"That's probably the biggest uncertainty, a lot of people like to extrapolate results from polls,\" said Rossana Castiglioni, a professor of political science at Diego Portales University. \"But the truth is we know relatively little from this 50%, from this half of the population that abstains from electoral processes.\" Boric has said he would launch a new process to draft another constitution if the current one fails on Sunday, while other political factions want to amend the current text. Regardless of the result, experts say Chileans still want the change that they clamored for in 2019-2020. \"People are still waiting for the social agenda that was outlined after the (2019) social uprising, a trend that brought Boric to the presidency,\" said Axel Callis, a political analyst for pollster TuInfluyes, adding protest anger could be reignited. \"If this doesn't lead to deep changes in terms of social rights, health and pensions, then we're going to be left with an explosive atmosphere.\"","119":"MANCHESTER, England, Sept 1 (Reuters) - FIFA will hold an appeal hearing on Sept. 15 in the case of an Ecuador player that Chile claim played while ineligible during World Cup qualifying, the governing body told Reuters on Thursday. The Chilean Football Association has appealed FIFA’s June 10th decision to dismiss their complaint that Ecuador’s Byron Castillo was born in Tumaco, Colombia in 1995 and not in the Ecuadorean city of General Villamil Playas in 1998 as stated on his official documents. Castillo played in eight of Ecuador’s 18 qualifying games for the Qatar World Cup. Ecuador have denied that the player was ineligible. FIFA said it had asked the Ecuadorean Football Association (FEF) to make Castillo available for the appeal hearing. The Chilean FA (ANPF) appealed the decision on July 1 and recently urged FIFA to speed up the process. Ecuador picked up 14 of their 26 points in matches Castillo played. If they had lost points for the games in which Castillo appeared, they would have missed out on a place in Qatar. Ecuador are in Group A alongside hosts Qatar, Senegal and the Netherlands. The World Cup kicks off on Nov. 21. Eduardo Carlezzo, the lawyer representing the Football Federation of Chile in its FIFA Appeal, told Reuters in an email that the governing body had called Castillo himself to testify. “We thank FIFA for this clarity around our appeal hearing and for calling Byron Castillo to answer the many questions they must have regarding his eligibility and therefore Ecuador’s qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup,\" he wrote. “We have provided a significant amount of evidence to FIFA proving that the player was born in Colombia and his Ecuadorian birth certificate is fake. Finally, on September 15 Byron Castillo has the opportunity to explain the situation and then, for the sake of fair play, justice can take its course.”","120":"GENEVA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Michelle Bachelet, once a political detainee under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and a doctor for tortured children, pledged to be the champion of victims when she became U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2018. But as her tenure ends this week, family members and advocates for those caught up in China's repression of dissent have said they feel let down despite the last-minute release of a report critical of China, and they are calling for a more outspoken successor.  read more  \"I feel terribly disappointed that our letter (to Bachelet) was totally disregarded and no follow up,\" said Luo Shengchun, the wife of jailed Chinese rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi, who wrote to Bachelet seeking his release in May, shortly before Bachelet visited China on a rare fact-finding tour. \"I wish for them to replace her with an officer with a more clear position with China. The UN can really do much more,\" she told Reuters from New York where she lives in voluntary exile awaiting the verdict of Ding's trial on state subversion charges.  read more  Luo's comments reflect a widely held view among civil society and Western states that Bachelet, a former Chilean president, has been too soft on some governments when they are backsliding on human rights around the world. However, they welcomed the release on her last day of a report on the Xinjiang region which said China's \"arbitrary and discriminatory detention\" of Uyghurs and other Muslims may constitute crimes against humanity.  read more  \"We are mostly disappointed and expected her to be firmer on China overall; however leaving with this report helps her office's credibility,\" said Zumretay Arkin, spokesperson for the World Uyghur Congress. Bachelet had earlier said she has been under \"tremendous pressure\" both to publish and not to publish, with Beijing asking her to bury it.  read more  China, which vigorously denies any allegations of wrongdoing in Xinjiang, wrote a 131-page response to the report, which its mission in Geneva described as a \"farce\". On Ding's case, China's foreign ministry said it is a country governed by the rule of law, and everyone is equal before the law. Bachelet's critics hope her retirement on Wednesday will mark a fresh start. \"We are looking for somebody who is willing to speak out in a principled way, regardless of the perpetrator,\" said Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth. However, her defenders say her political skills won her access, such as the first trip by a high commissioner to China since 2005 and a deal to bring monitors to Venezuela. They also praised her attacks on systemic racism and commitment to new environmental rights. Bachelet defended her approach to the job. \"Constructive engagement creates the space for criticism to be acknowledged and acted upon, to ultimately help make a difference in people’s lives on the ground,\" she said on Thursday. The battle over Bachelet's legacy embodies the political tensions between more liberal and conservative countries over human rights arising in the choice of successor. The process is under way but a void is now certain with Deputy High Commissioner Nada Al-Nashif stepping in temporarily. It is up to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to make the appointment which then needs to be confirmed by the General Assembly. The roughly 10 potential candidates include U.N. official Volker Türk of Austria, career diplomat Federico Villegas from Argentina, and Senegal's Adama Dieng, who previously advised Guterres on genocide prevention, U.N. sources and diplomats said. They say China and Russia, both powerful permanent Security Council members, will favour a politically minded successor, indicating a possible battle ahead. \"Western states and NGOs are pushing for a human rights advocate but a global policeman would be unacceptable to China, Russia and many developing countries,\" said Marc Limon, executive director of Universal Rights Group. If a choice is made quickly, one of the first challenges will be addressing the next meeting of the Geneva-based Human Rights Council starting on Sept. 12, set to discuss possible Ukraine war crimes. The body's decisions, while not legally binding, carry political weight and it can authorise investigations. There have been recent hard-fought debates over sexual rights as well as the Yemen war amid growing signs that absolute monarchies and autocracies are gaining influence.  read more  Limon said another politician from a developing country could help bridge the differences. But for others, like Bachelet's vocal predecessor, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, there is only one way to do the job. \"My hope is that her successor will be strong, independent-minded, not easily intimidated by anyone,\" he told Reuters. \"I would say: don't do it if you are going to be weak.\"","121":"SANTIAGO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric said in a speech late Tuesday that any changes in the country's tax law that would affect the mining sector are still up for discussion, with a vote scheduled in Congress in coming weeks. Boric said the industry had been historically unwilling to reach agreements with the government, and he hoped to have a \"technically sound debate\" regarding a mining tax reform plan currently on the table. The head of national mining society Sonami, Diego Hernandez, said earlier Tuesday the sector had not been listened to while the country's tax reform was being drafted, and the government's proposals were \"extreme and dogmatic\". Hernandez said a proposed royalty would put mining operations with higher costs at risk, and he hoped talks would lead to reform that gave equal weight to tax collection and \"the future viability of the sector.\" He also hoped a pending constitutional reform, separate from the tax proposal, would favor economic development in Chile, the world's top copper producer and second-largest produce of lithium. The constitutional debate and additional proposals affecting mining have generated uncertainty in the sector in recent months. Hernandez said he hoped the final reform would be clear enough for miners to feel confident pouring in an estimated $80 billion into the country over the next few years.","122":"LIMA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The presidents of the nations making up the Andean Community - Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia - said on Monday they would like Venezuela, Chile and Argentina to join the group as much of South America shifts left. \"If we manage to integrate Chile, Venezuela and Argentina...I think this would significantly change things and our voice would be heard much more clearly on the world stage,\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro said. The presidents were in Lima on Monday for a meeting as Ecuador passes on the bloc's presidency to Peru. Petro's remarks are also his first on a foreign tour after taking over the presidency earlier this month. The desire to expand the Andean Community comes as much of South America has shifted left. Since 2020, left-wing governments have taken over in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Chile. Ecuador, led by right-wing Guillermo Lasso, is now the outlier in the group. Venezuela and Chile were once members, while Argentina has never joined. Venezuela left in the early 2000s under the socialist presidency of Hugo Chavez, while Chile was a founding member but left in 1976 during the right-wing dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. \"I would like to express the importance it would have for the Andean Community, and the benefits for its members, to have Chile and Venezuela rejoin,\" Peruvian President Pedro Castillo said at the event. \"And why not think about a sub-regional integration around the idea of the Andean fatherland that includes our sister Republic of Argentina, with which we share not just the Andes but also a shared heritage,\" Castillo added.","123":"SANTIAGO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A Chilean constitution that bans private property and allows abortions in the ninth month of a pregnancy. Private companies counting votes. A flood of prisoners and recent migrants allowed to vote in the upcoming constitutional referendum. All these stories have gone viral on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp in Chile as citizens prepare to vote on a new constitution on Sept. 4, but all are inaccurate. Nearly 80 percent of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020, a year after violent protests against inequality rattled the world's top copper-producing nation. But support has dropped and polls show voters are more likely to reject the new text. The proposed constitution, written by predominantly independent and progressive elected constituents, is easily available on the streets, online, or in a podcast format. Focusing on social rights and the environment, it is a sharp shift from the current market-oriented constitution that dates back to the Augusto Pinochet era.  read more  Paulina Valenzuela, a statistician and managing partner of a public polling company Datavoz, says most misinformation over the past year centered around the constituents who were drawing up the document, but switched to the new text itself after it was completed in early July. \"More than false I'd say they're half truths,\" Valenzuela said. \"Where there's an interpretation of the text, of how the norm or article should be interpreted.\" Valenzuela said it's hard to quantify what impact misinformation has on polls, but 65% of respondents reported encountering misinformation in the last week of July. Fabian Padilla, who founded Fact Check CL, a fact-checking site that started during the 2019 protests, said sites can't declare legal interpretations false, in contrast to, for example, the kind of patently false medical claims that circulated during the pandemic. \"With Covid, misinformation was very consistent, repeating the same patterns, some of it very absurd,\" Padilla said. \"But with constitutional text it's very debatable.\" This leads to consultations with legal experts and longer verification times. \"It hurts us a lot when there's a fact check that takes us days and we know that just one day more means millions and millions more visits,\" Padilla said. Marcelo Mendoza, an informatics professor at the computer science department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, has studied the spread of misinformation in Chile for years. False claims about the new constitution travel three times faster on Twitter than news from reputable outlets, he said. He added that the false claims make the majority of their impact within 24 hours, a timeframe social media companies struggle to beat. \"They're always getting there late,\" Mendoza said. The plebiscite itself and Chile's election agency Servel have also been the subjects of misinformation. Servel's President Andres Tagle says this is the fifth election cycle in which the agency has been hit, adding that the attacks have been marked by increasing intensity and a cumulative effect on public trust. Twitter and Facebook parent Meta said they have been actively working with Chile's government and fact checkers to help stop the spread of misinformation. \"We provided (Servel) with a training session on Twitter Rules while having an open and constant communication with them,\" a Twitter spokesperson told Reuters. The company did not say how many accounts have been suspended or tweets have been removed but pointed to its Transparency Report. The report says the Chilean government requested information 19 times regarding 33 accounts in the second half of 2021 and the company did not comply in any of those instances. A Twitter spokesperson, citing privacy concerns, said the company releases non-public information about Twitter users only in response to \"a subpoena, court order, other valid legal process, or in response to a valid emergency request.\" Meta says it activated a rapid-response team on Facebook and Instagram to identify violations, is working with fact checkers including Fast Check CL, and limits the reach of posts found to be misleading. When it comes to its WhatsApp encrypted messaging system, Meta says it's focusing on reducing the virality of messages, which has reduced the number of forwarded messages by 25% globally since 2020. But Tagle said he thought the measures still fell short of what is needed. The election agency's president also added that he would like social companies to be regulated by Chilean law, making them responsible for posts if they can't identify the user. \"I don't believe in the social media companies' intentions,\" Tagle said. \"They sell advertising, so when more people see their content, when they see fake things, it's also welcome.\"","124":"SANTIAGO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - A week before Chileans vote on a proposed constitution that promises sweeping changes to the Andean country's institutions, a controversial performance arguing for its passage went viral on Sunday, offering ammunition to opponents and causing headaches for supporters.

Both opponents and supporters of the proposed charter, which seeks to replace the one inherited from the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, condemned the action and even announced legal action. \"I just saw a video of how they put the Chilean flag in a certain part (of the body) at an Approve event in Valparaiso,\" tweeted Senator Matias Walker, an opponent of the draft constitution. The official Approve campaign condemned the performance in a statement, describing it as \"absolutely distant from the values that represent Approve.\" The performance could face legal consequences. The Undetectables did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through the group's Instagram account. Government spokesperson Camila Vallejo said that both the ombudsman and the government undersecretary for children had filed lawsuits with the public prosecutor's office, and that other types of measures would be evaluated. \"I think everything has a limit,\" Vallejo said in a local television interview. \"Public space belongs to everyone and because of that we have to protect it ... that (performance) did not respect everyone who was there, including children.\" Although the idea of drafting a new constitution was overwhelmingly supported in a referendum at the end of 2020, several controversies over the impact of the draft's content have reduced support.  read more  The latest published polls showed an advantage for the option of rejecting the proposal.","125":"SANTIAGO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Chilean authorities warned that the area around a copper mine where a sinkhole suddenly appeared is at high risk of further collapse and has set up a security perimeter. Government agencies and the mine's owners are studying what caused the appearance in late July of the mysterious hole that spans 36.5 meters (120 feet) in diameter. The area is at high risk of further cracks or sinking near the Alcaparrosa mine, about 665 km (413 miles) north of Santiago, the Committee for Disaster Risk Management of Chile's northern Atacama region determined on Saturday night. \"Considering that the said scenario presents a threat to the life and physical integrity of people, access to said zone has been restricted until the technical studies warrant it,\" the emergency office said on its website.

The Chilean state-owned miner said it now expects output to reach between 1.49 million and 1.51 million tonnes this year, down from a previous forecast of 1.61 million tonnes. The guidance cut was disclosed in a letter to Chile's regulator late on Thursday, in which Codelco mentioned the redesign it was forced to implement at its Division Ministro Hales mine after a landslide late last year, lowering recovery levels at the site. It also said geomechanical reasons and material handling system issues affected the century-old Chuquicamata mine. \"All efforts will continue to be made so we can achieve the highest possible level of production by the end of the year,\" interim chief executive Andre Sougarret said. Codelco has also faced fatal incidents recently.

Chile's environmental regulator SMA last week issued a series of measures against the Ojos del Salado mine, run by Lundin's local unit, alleging its \"over-extraction of material\" could have caused the sinkhole.  read more  Ojos del Salado's president, Luis Sanchez, said the assessment only takes into account nearby mining activity, which alone could not explain the formation of the sinkhole that has grown to a diameter of 36.5 meters (39.9 yards). \"This phenomenon is clearly due to multiple factors in our opinion and in order to elucidate the origin it is necessary to analyze all these factors,\" said Sanchez in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. The executive said Lundin had conducted its own geophysical, topographic, hydrographic and other studies. \"While it is true that we cannot be sure of the cause, we can indicate through these studies that there are relevant factors like soil composition, climatic episodes like 2017 mudslides, July's rains and, of course, the mining activity under the sinkhole,\" he said. During a visit to the site in the country's north on Thursday, Chilean President Gabriel Boric said resources had been made available so studies could be conducted to give people living near the sinkhole \"peace of mind.\" It was up to experts to define the cause of the phenomenon, he added, rather than \"high authorities of the company involved.\" Earlier this month, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said Chile will apply harsh sanctions to those responsible for the huge sinkhole that appeared in late July in the mining region.  read more  Sanchez said Lundin's studies show the subsoil in the area has a clay-calcareous composition, which \"could have caused a progressive degeneration\" that leads to sinkholes. He also pointed to heavy rains two weeks prior to the sinkhole's formation that in three days dropped more precipitation than in 2017, last decade's wettest year. Lundin owns 80% of the mine near the sinkhole, while 20% is held by Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining (5713.T) and Sumitomo Corp (8053.T).

The bill, which aims to reduce the working week from 45 to 40 hours within five years, has stalled in Congress since it was introduced in 2017 by then-lawmaker and current government spokesperson Camila Vallejo. Boric has given \"urgency\" to the bill, a provision in Chile's constitution that forces lawmakers to consider a bill when mandated by the president.

The center-left government has promoted dialogue with unions and worker federations along with representatives from small, medium and large companies at a time when the economy of the world's largest copper producer is slowing down and faces strong inflationary pressures after a rapid post-pandemic recovery.

The Andean country's economy grew 5.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, but showed no growth from the previous three months in seasonally adjusted terms. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 5.7% increase year-on-year and a 0.3% rise over the previous quarter. The performance highlighted Chile's struggle to grow as the central bank aggressively tightens its monetary policy to tame soaring inflation, which reached a near three-decade high last month. \"Chile's economy merely stagnated in Q2 and the chances are high that it will fall into recession over the second half of the year,\" Capital Economics' Latin America economist Kimberley Sperrfechter said in a note. She also mentioned that building current account risks were set to keep the peso on the backfoot, with the local currency weakening 2.2% against the dollar following the latest economic figures. The central bank said in a report that data were mixed among sectors, with personal care and transportation fuelling growth in services activities while mining and agriculture dropped on a yearly basis in the world's largest copper producer. Andres Abadia, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Chile's economy performed poorly in the first half, reflecting tighter fiscal and monetary policy while domestic fundamentals deteriorated. In the first quarter, Chile's economy had contracted 0.8% from the previous three months, losing ground after a solid recovery from the pandemic downturn last year.  read more  \"(The economy) is now practically on a technical recession,\" Abadia said. \"The bad news is that leading indicators, including business and consumer confidence, suggest that the downtrend will continue over the coming quarters due to an array of shocks\".","131":"SANTIAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Chile's SMA environmental regulator said on Tuesday it had issued a series of measures against a copper mine owned by Canada's Lundin Mining Corp (LUN.TO) after a sinkhole opened up near one of the company's mines. The SMA ordered six \"urgent and transitory\" measures while it continues to investigate causes that generated the sinkhole that measures 36.5 meters (129 ft) in diameter in Tierra Amarilla, some 665 km (413 miles) north of Santiago. \"After several inspection visits to the area, we detected that the company was carrying out an over-extraction of material, which could have caused an increase in outcropping waters that have not been adequately controlled,\" environment superintendent Emmanuel Ibarra said. Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said last week the government would seek to apply harsh sanctions to those responsible for the sinkhole, citing the overexploitation of the nearby deposit.  read more  Measures announced Tuesday include a soil stability study, monitoring levels in the waterhole, hydro-geochemical analysis of major compounds and trace elements of groundwater, and a study evaluating the current drainage system. The regulator also requested a study to verify whether the volumes of water extracted by Ojos del Salado mine have detrimented nearby aquifers. The Canadian firm owns 80% of the property, while the remaining 20% is in the hands of Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining (5713.T) and Sumitomo Corporation.

The call comes after the robbery last week of some 500 ounces of gold worth the equivalent of $1 million from the premises of a company, in addition to attempts to rob copper trucks and a train transporting copper cathodes, according to the National Mining Society (Sonami). \"We hope that the levels of crime, which have increased in the country recently, do not directly affect us and that the different operations can continue operating without putting their workers at risk,\" said Sonami's president, Diego Hernandez, in a press release. \"It is key that the authority adopts the necessary measures to ensure safety in mining operations and the transport of copper and other mineral shipments,\" he added. Concerns have mounted in recent months over a rise in crime in the north of the country, which is also affected by an irregular migration crisis and has even led local authorities to ask the government to declare a state of emergency. The government has launched a plan to increase police presence and surveillance in the northern region, which has vast unpopulated areas due to its location in the middle of the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world. The local mining industry has for years reported the theft of goods such as copper by organized gangs, and police have reported various operations in which tons of copper ore have been recovered from robberies. Photos and videos have circulated on social media of strangers throwing copper plates from trains transporting the reddish metal in the middle of the South American nation's arid northern region. Neither the PDI nor Sonami immediately had figures available on the extent of the crimes.","133":"LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Antofagasta (ANTO.L) posted a fall in half-year profit on Thursday, as higher costs, lower grades and a persistent drought in Chile hit the miner's copper production. It said it would slash its interim dividend to 9.2 cents per share from a record 23.6 cents last year, joining fellow miners including Rio Tinto (RIO.L), (RIO.AX) and Anglo American (AAL.L) in lowering payouts after last year's bonanza. Mining firms have also warned about future returns on fears that slower growth or recession in key markets could dent commodity demand in the next few months. Antofagasta, majority owned by Chile's wealthy Luksic family, saw its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the first six months fall to $1.24 billion, compared with $2.4 billion last year. The company's London-listed shares opened 2.2% lower, underperforming most of its peers. Antofagasta's profit surged to its highest ever in 2021 when copper prices reached record levels, allowing it to make a record shareholder payout of $1.4 billion for the year. It said it remains on track to produce its revised guidance of 640,000-660,000 tonnes of copper for the full year. \"We expect the remainder of the year to look very different from the first half - as production improves quarter-on-quarter,\" Chief Executive Iván Arriagada said. The FTSE 100 company operates four copper mines in Chile, the world's no. 1 producer accounting for 30% of global output, and no. 2 producer of battery metal lithium. The South American country faces a water crisis due to a drought that has lasted more than a decade, hitting mining output. The miner increased its cost estimate for its Centinela concentrator expansion to $3.7 billion from a 2015 forecast of $2.7 billion and said it will decide whether to proceed with it in early 2023. \"Higher capex forecasts for Centinela provide a further complication for an equity that is already navigating the current uncertainty on mining tax reform and the Chilean constitutional referendum,\" Tyler Broda at RBC Capital Markets said. Chile will vote on a new constitution on Sept. 4, while a tax reform bill proposes increasing copper royalties on firms mining more than 50,000 tonnes a year.  read more ","134":"Aug 10 (Reuters) - Chile is taking another look at health in safety in its mines after two workers died on a mining construction project in July and a giant sinkhole more recently opened up near a copper mine. Chile President Gabriel Boric said on Wednesday he wants to ratify an International Labor Organization (ILO) convention on health and safety in mines. The rules were issued in 1995 and first adopted by Botswana, Finland, Spain and Sweden. Brazil adopted the rules, known as convention 176, in 2006 and Peru in 2008. Trade associations and legislators have requested government support for convention 176, which includes guarantees for workers, while requiring the state to adopt certain legislative standards. \"Although accident rates have decreased in the last 10 years, we still have a lot to do,\" Boric said during a speech commemorating Chile's Miner Day. The president said that there were 20 accidental deaths in the mining industry last year and wants to reach a goal of zero. In July, two workers died in separate accidents at different construction projects for state-owned Codelco (CODEL.UL), the world's largest copper producer.  read more  Chile's mining regulator Sernageomin found \"deficiencies\" in both cases, noting that the deaths could have been prevented, bringing attention to compliance with industry safety standards in Chile, the world's No.1 copper producer. Ratifying the convention would mean stricter safety measures, more government oversight and allow workers to file lawsuits to the ILO. Boric also mentioned the recent sinkhole that occurred near a copper mine in northern Chile that is still being investigated.  read more  \"What if that sinkhole happened in a town? What if it happened in a work site?\" Boric said. \"What would we be lamenting today? It could perfectly have happened.\"","135":"Aug 7 (Reuters) - (In Aug. 7 story, Lundin Mining corrects information to add Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd as a co-owner of the property in paragraph 6.) A sinkhole in Chile has doubled in size, growing large enough to engulf France's Arc de Triomphe and prompting officials to order work to stop at a nearby copper mine. The sinkhole, which emerged on July 30, now stretches 50 meters (160 feet) across and goes down 200 meters (656 feet). Seattle's Space Needle would also comfortably fit in the black pit, as would six Christ the Redeemer statues from Brazil stacked head-to-head, giant arms outstretched.

In addition to ordering all work to stop, the geology and mining service said it was starting a \"sanctioning process.\" The agency did not provide details on what that action would involve. Lundin did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Although no one was hurt in Wednesday's \"operational incident,\" Codelco said it had launched an investigation to determine the cause. Production had not been halted. Codelco has been under pressure to improve safety policies since two people died at its mines last month, one at Chuquicamata. Mining regulator Sernageomin told Reuters last week that the national mining industry had deficiencies in safety protocols and had to improve practices. Codelco said the latest accident had involved the upper part of a \"material dome\" and a conveyor belt that had given way. Social media images showed the rupture of the top of a structure at the mine, which is in the north of Chile. In a brief statement, the company said it would implement a contingency plan to \"address operational continuity.\" It later told Reuters that the incident had affected one of the conveyor belts that fed the mine's concentrator from three sources of ore. The affected belt carried around 15% of ore fed to the plant.

Argentina and Chile have since also hosted the games, in 1978 and 1962, respectively. \"It's just for the World Cup to be hosted where it all began 100 years later,\" Ignacio Alonso, president of the Uruguayan Football Association, told reporters. Dominguez said there are \"more than sufficient\" reasons for FIFA to accept the four countries' single candidacy. The 2030 World Cup will follow the 2026 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States. For now, the South American countries' top competition appears to come from Spain and Portugal, which last month submitted a joint bid to host the tournament.","140":"SANTIAGO, Aug 1(Reuters) - The race to approve or reject Chile's new constitution in September enters its final weeks as the \"no\" vote remains in the lead and progressive President Gabriel Boric and his government has taken a more active role in the race. According to poll released Sunday by Cadem, 38% of voters plan to approve the new text, up from a low of 33% in late June. Despite weeks of gaining support, the \"yes\" vote dropped 1 point compared to last week and still trails those planning to reject by 10 points. The rise comes as former President Michelle Bachelet, who is ending her term as head of the U.N. human rights office, has backed the proposal and President Gabriel Boric's government, which isn't legally allowed to campaign, has taken a more active role in disseminating information about the text. That greater prominence led Chile's comptroller's office to launch an investigation last week into alleged electoral interventionism, mainly regarding an information campaign by the Ministry of the General Secretariat of the Government, the presidency's communications office headed by spokeswoman Camila Vallejo. \"The comptroller has to audit,\" Boric told reporters after the announcement. \"But I have no doubt that the spirit in which we have acted is not in any case of interventionism, but of disseminating information.\" The communications office declined to respond to inquiries from Reuters. Political analyst Cristobal Bellolio said the \"yes\" vote is linked to support for the government, which fell drastically after taking office in March, but has been recovering. \"The government is already gambling completely for trying to increase its popularity in these weeks,\" said Bellolio, listing recent announcements like the expansion of access to public health.

On Monday, company executives and regulators showed details of the accident during a session of the country's Chamber of Deputies Mining Commission. During the session it was revealed that a truck driven by a contractor who was working in the pre-stripping process slid off a platform at a dump while the operator was outside of the control cabin.

Pacheco added that an internal commission was investigating what happened, in addition to the government enquiries. The stoppage was ordered after regulators detected several faults including problems with parking yards and access controls. Regulators also found a lack of accredited training and poor maintenance according to David Montenegro, the head of mining regulator Sernageomin. \"The standards of the divisions are not consistent with the standards that the vice presidency (of projects) works on and we have detected this on more than one occasion,\" Montenegro said.

In an interview with a local television channel, the leftist president said that since Chile's citizens voted to draft a new constitution in 2020, the process would have to be carried out again if the current proposal. \"If the plan is rejected, what will happen is that we will have to prolong the process for another year and a half, where everything will have to be discussed from the beginning,\" said Boric, who has avoided speaking of alternatives if voters reject the proposed text in September. Boric has stated that both options - approving or rejecting the text - are legitimate, but his government seeks to promote broad social reforms that would be blocked by the current constitution. \"The constitutional process, if rejected, has to continue by the terms decided by the people of Chile,\" Boric said. \"Not (to continue tweaking) the current constitution.\" The current constitution, heavily pro-market, was enacted during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Congress is currently debating lowering the number of votes needed to modify the current constitution in case the proposed text is rejected. In October 2020, a year after protests broke out across the country, almost 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution.

The book outlays the country's proposed new constitution. Its 388 articles touching on social rights, gender, politics and the environment aim to close the door on the current text, drawn up in 1980 under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Chileans will vote to approve or reject the new constitution on Sept. 4. While they overwhelmingly backed the plan to write a new one in a referendum two years ago, opinion polls suggest the final draft may be rejected. Support has dropped on fears that some of the proposals from the assembly in charge of formulating the text are too radical.  read more  In capital Santiago, long lines have been forming outside bookstores and street stalls of people looking to pick up the recently-finalized text - a bright purple paperback decorated with a Chilean flag. Street vendors said they were selling dozens of copies a day. \"The money's here now,\" said Alfredo Lopez, a vendor who normally sells fruit on Santiago's Ahumada thoroughfare. Lopez sold masks when the pandemic hit and now has a table full of the books and a hand-made yellow sign touting the text for 3,000 pesos ($3). While Lopez hasn't read the text and doesn't plan to, the stream of customers is constant and Lopez says he's been selling 70 to 80 copies a day. The new constitution, born from anger about stark inequality in one of the region's richest nations that burst out in fiery protests in 2019, has become a lightning rod for debate between those who want to protect Chile's market-orientated economic model that helped drive decades of growth and those seeking a more socially-inclusive ideal. That's become more intense with rising inflation and a slowing economy, linked to global fears of a recession and the war in Ukraine driving up food and energy prices. The price of copper has plummeted and Chile's currency is at an all-time low. \"Conversations heat up quickly, people are really tense,\" said Isidora Varela, 25, a communications professional who bought a copy of the constitution on Tuesday, saying she felt it was her duty to read the text and inform others. \"Not everyone's going to read the constitutional text because the information is super dense,\" she said. Varela said she had seen a lot of misinformation and \"fake news\" relating to the proposed constitution circulating on social media. Mireya Davila, a public policy professor at the University of Chile, says both sides still have time to win over voters and a deciding factor will be how effectively the approve campaign communicates what the text says. \"I think an informed vote is key, but I don't know if that's going to happen,\" Davila said. Carlos Bastias, another seller, said heated arguments and fights consistently break out between customers. \"I think that in a few days I'm going to have to open up a (boxing) ring here and be a referee,\" Bastias said, adding that he's read about half of the new constitution but avoids giving his opinion to customers. \"This (debate) is only going to escalate,\" Bastias said, noting that many cite Venezuela's 1999 constitution drafted after a national referendum as a warning sign of the perils of change. \"People are worried because it could lift up a country, but you know, it's destroyed others.\"","146":"LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios reached the first Grand Slam semi-final of his chequered career with a comfortable 6-4 6-3 7-6(5) victory over Chile's Cristian Garin at Wimbledon on Wednesday, setting up a mouth-watering clash with Rafa Nadal. The unseeded 27-year-old lost the opening nine points on Court One but ultimately had too much firepower for Garin who had hoped to become Chile's first Wimbledon semi-finalist. In surpassing his previous best Wimbledon run to the quarter-finals eight years ago, Kyrgios becomes the first Australian man to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 U.S. Open. On the eve of the match, Kyrgios was summoned to appear in a Canberra court next month on an alleged common assault charge, hardly ideal preparation for one of his biggest matches. But any off-court distractions he managed to put to one side in a relatively low-volume display sprinkled occasionally with the instinctive shot-making that makes him such a draw. As in his five-set win over American Brandon Nakashima in the previous round, Kyrgios kept his volatile temperament under wraps, although he regularly lambasted his sizeable entourage as the match dragged on, calling for more support. Once again his serve underpinned his game, digging him out of trouble whenever Garin threatened to drag himself back into a contest that drifted away from him after his fast start. Kyrgios saved eight of the nine break points he faced, including two at 4-4 in the first set. Garin, who beat Kyrgios's compatriot Alex De Minaur from two sets down in the previous round, battled hard to extend the third set to a tiebreaker and led 5-3 in it before Kyrgios hit back to win the last four points. One of tennis's great enigmas will now face Nadal in the semi-finals, a clash he predicted would be \"probably the most-watched match of all time.\" World number 40 Kyrgios, the lowest-ranked semi-finalist at Wimbledon since Marat Safin (75) and Rainer Schuettler (94) in 2008, will start as underdog, but will relish the occasion. \"I never thought I'd be in the semi-final of a Grand Slam. I thought that ship had sailed -- that I may have wasted that window in my career,\" he said. \"I had lost the love, lost the fire, lost the spark. Then some things just changed in my life. I kind of just rediscovered that I've got a lot of people that want me to play, that I play for. I've got a lot left in the tank.\" Kyrgios has been almost meek and mild since his explosive third-round clash with fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, after which his opponent called him a bully with an evil side. He has let his tennis talk and, more importantly, shown a focus many thought was beyond him. Even after a slow start on Wednesday there was no negativity and he broke back to level at 3-3. Garin got lucky with a net cord to get two break points at 4-4 but the Australian slammed the door shut and then broke to love as Garrin cracked. Kyrgios broke early in the second set and saved break points at 3-1 and 4-2 before sealing the set with an ace -- one of 17 he fired past the south American. The third set was tight but Kyrgios always had another gear. Garin believes Kyrgios could go all the way. \"I played all of the great serves on the Tour -- and for me he's the best server,\" the 26-year-old said. \"He has great chances to win the tournament.\"","147":"SANTIAGO, July 6 (Reuters) - Electoral campaigns to approve or reject Chile's proposed new constitution officially began on Wednesday and high-profile political and public figures have started picking sides at a time when public support is faltering.

Chile's conservative politicians have opposed the new constitution from the beginning, but former socialist President Ricardo Lagos dealt a blow to the approval campaign Tuesday after releasing a statement saying both the proposed and the existing constitutions are far from gathering support and rallying \"the great majority of citizens.\" \"What happened with Lagos is a tremendously important fact when support for the proposal was already falling,\" said Kenneth Bunker, head of political consultancy Tresquintos. Bunker added that Lagos's position \"opens the door for other figures from the center-left to join.\" Former president and UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has previously expressed support, but members of her government, including former Finance Minister Andres Velasco, came out against the new constitution on Wednesday. Nearly 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020 to replace a text that dates back to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorshipwhich ended in 1990, but support has been dropping for months amid political controversies surrounding the process.  read more  Cadem's latest poll shows 51% of respondents plan to vote the new magna carta, an all-time high, while only 15% remain undecided. \"People want a new constitution, but apparently they don't want this one,\" Bunker said, adding that the government needs a \"Plan B\" to meet social demands if the new text is rejected.

Several high schools around Santiago were taken over by students; one was set on fire while hooded youths clashed with police and burned city buses. In June, the prestigious Internado Nacional Barros Arana (INBA) high school in Santiago was temporarily shut over \"severe\" violence, including the principal's office being set ablaze. In a country that has seen rapid but uneven development in recent decades, angry protests by students over expensive and poor-quality school and university education have become more frequent. For youngsters, that is now exacerbated, experts say, by pandemic-related behavior issues. Although some signs of negative long-term effects of coronavirus lockdowns on children have been seen elsewhere, Chile seems to be particularly hard hit. \"We haven't seen anything elsewhere as drastic or dramatic as here,\" said Francisca Morales, UNICEF's Chile education officer. The main impact had been on teens and preteens returning to school after going through puberty in isolation, she said. Chile's Education Superintendent reported a 56% jump in violent incidents in the last semester compared to 2018 and 2019 before the pandemic, a surge that has troubled politicians, psychologists and teachers. \"After these two years they chafe more with authority and discipline. There's a rejection of authority figures,\" said Esteban Abarca, a high school teacher at the INBA school in Santiago. \"It's not comfortable for anyone to be in class when they're burning things or attacking the principal.\" Chilean students' history of protest goes back to mobilizations against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 1980s. Students - including current President Gabriel Boric - led demonstrations to demand education reforms in 2006 and 2011, and in 2019 more widespread protests saw months of rioting, with metro stations and churches burned. Florencia Acevedo, a 16-year-old high school student in Santiago, said protests were the only way to be heard and while she did not agree with bus burnings or clashes with the police, she sympathized with the anger students felt. \"I understand those who do it because you act with rage sometimes, shame and pain,\" she said, citing issues like schools missing basic infrastructure, including doors and decent bathrooms. \"Adults don't take students seriously so we take over schools, because if we try to talk they don't listen,\" Acevedo said. \"We regretfully live in a society that reacts to violence. If I give you violence, you give me what I want.\" Education Minister Antonio Avila told Reuters the issue was linked to wider social unease. Indigenous violence in the south has hit Boric's popularity, while a new constitution that was meant to help iron out deep-seated issues of inequality is at risk of failing to win enough support. \"The problems that occur in school communities are a reflection of the problems we have as a society,\" Avila said.","149":"SANTIAGO, July 4 (Reuters) - Chile's constitutional assembly handed over the final text of a proposed new constitution to President Gabriel Boric on Monday, finalizing a year-long process to replace the country's magna carta that dates back to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. The ceremony, held in Santiago, kicks off a two-month campaign to sway voters to approve or reject the proposed text during a mandatory plebiscite on Sept 4. \"Today we start a new phase,\" Boric said after receiving a purple booklet with a Chilean flag and 388 articles that could lay a new foundation for the world's top copper producer. \"It's now about reading and debating the constitutional proposal that's been handed to the country.\" The proposed text pulls back from the current free market constitution to focus on social rights, gender equality, indigenous autonomy and the environment. \"It will once again be the people who have the last word on their destiny,\" Boric said. Nearly 80% of Chileans voted to draft a new constitution in 2020 after violent protests against inequality rattled the Andean country the previous year, but support has since dropped considerably. A new poll released by Cadem Sunday night showed 51% of respondents plan on rejecting the new constitution, the highest since the pollster started tracking. The 155-member constitutional assembly, consisting of mostly independent and left leaning members, faced several political controversies that led to the decreasing support.  read more  \"I'm an imperfect and real person,\" Gaspar Dominguez, vice president of the assembly said during the ceremony. \"And the process was like that: imperfect and real.\" Boric, who has been closely linked to the process, is facing his worst approval ratings.  read more  September's vote, Boric said, should not be an assessment of the government but a debate \"about the future and destiny of Chile for the next four or five decades.\"","150":"LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Chile's Cristian Garin showed amazing tenacity to come from two sets and 3-0 down and save two match points as he beat Australian Alex de Minaur in a hugely entertaining five-set slug fest on Monday to reach his first grand slam quarter-final Garin eventually triumphed 2-6 5-7 7-6 (3) 6-4 7-6(6) after four hours 34 minutes of superb tennis that brought a standing ovation from Wimbledon's packed Number Two Court. The two men hammered at each other from start to finish with a crowd-pleasing sprinkling of classy drop shots and volleys in among the relentlessly accurate groundstrokes and lung-busting chases to reach them. De Minaur, a supreme athlete who does not know the meaning of a lost cause, took the first two sets and led 3-0 in the third but Garin hit back, saved two match points at 4-5 in the fifth and then won the new \"first to 10\" final-set tiebreak to set up a last-eight meeting with Nick Kyrgios. “I just gave everything I have, it was a very tough fight,\" said Garin.\"I am exhausted. I just gave my best, I went to the net and tried to be aggressive with my serve as well -- I think that was the key.” Di Minaur had won all three of their previous meetings, including on the grass of Eastbourne last month, and looked in charge as he took the first set reasonably comfortably and, though forced to work harder, added the second. Garin sank to his knees in despair after missing a golden opportunity to break for 5-4 in the third but regained his composure admirably to dominate the tiebreak. Buoyed up, he broke in the opening game of the fourth set and off they went again, each man probing wide and deep in attack then working desperately hard in defence. Garin seemed to have the momentum with two breaks and though he missed three break points on De Minaur’s serve he made sure on his own to set up a decider that had looked distinctly unlikely two hours earlier. Garin broke to love in the first game of the fifth set, only for De Minaur to do the same before both men settled back into their more familiar routine. Unsurprisingly, given his relentless court coverage, De Minaur initially appeared to tire in the fifth but he too found a second wind in a series of enthralling games where Garin had to work desperately hard to hold serve, no more so than when saving two match points at 4-5. De Minaur responded in kind by saving two break points and, almost inevitably, the match went into a tiebreak. It was nip and tuck to 5-5 before Garin claimed four points in a row to set up the biggest win of his career. \"It’s so special,\" Garin said. “I’ve been working hard all my life to be in this position. Wimbledon is a dream for me -- I always said that it is my favourite tournament.\"","151":"SANTIAGO, July 1 (Reuters) - Chile's finance minister, Mario Marcel, on Friday introduced a tax reform bill that increases copper mining royalties on companies that produce more than 50,000 tonnes a year and raises taxes on high-income earners to fund the government's proposed social programs and reforms. Chile is the world's top copper producer and is home to global copper giants like Codelco, BHP, Anglo American Glencore and Antofagasta. \"This means an increase in revenue from royalties, an increase in state participation in mining income,\" Marcel said. \"But also ensuring the mining sector has enough income to encourage investment.\" A press release from the treasury department says the plan has two components. One is an ad valorem tax between 1% and 2% for companies that produce between 50,000 and 200,000 tonnes of fine copper a year and a rate between 1% and 4% for those that produce more than 200,000. The other component is a rate between 2% and 32% on profits for copper prices between $2 and $5. Both components vary based on the price of copper. Smaller copper producers will continue with the current system, Marcel added. The bill aims to raise 4.1% of GDP over four years, with 0.7% going to a new guaranteed minimum pension fund. The proposal also raises taxes on high-income earners, capital gains and introduces a new wealth tax for citizens with more than $5 million in assets. Marcel noted Chile, with a tax collection rate of 20.7% of GDP, is below the OECD median of 34.7%. \"Historically, few countries have reached economic prosperity with a low tax load,\" Marcel said, adding that 97 percent of taxpayers won't be affected by the proposal. The bill also tries to reduce tax exemption and evasion while giving tax breaks for rent and care for children under 2 and the severely dependent.","152":"SANTIAGO, June 29 (Reuters) - The optimism engulfing Chile's leftist President Gabriel Boric as he took power in March has dimmed as inflation, social unrest and political missteps dent his popularity and fuel doubts about a push to steer the economy away from market-friendly policies. The former student protest leader handily won a presidential election in December, rattling business, particularly the mining sector, with his proposals to change tax laws to fund social spending and toughen environmental regulation. Chile is the world's top producer of copper and No. 2 producer of lithium. An opinion poll on Monday showed Boric's support plunging to 34%, the lowest levelof his presidency, closely mirroring waning backing for the country's planned new constitution. \"It's been three months of a lot of intensity, big lessons, self-criticism and learning to work as a team,\" Camila Vallejo, a communist in Boric's Cabinet who serves as the official spokesperson for his administration, told Reuters. \"The first difficult moment we had was our first week,\" she added, mentioning how the interior minister's visit to the restive Araucania region had been interrupted by gunfire. How Boric fares is key for Chile and a barometer for leftist governments in the region and their ability to win over voters angry with high gas and food prices, cooling economic growth and the residual impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Inflation in Chile is currently running at an 11.5% annual rate, far above the central bank's target range of 2% to 4%. Monthly inflation rose to almost a 30-year high in March. Boric marks a break from the Andean country's traditionally strait-laced leaders and remains a beacon for those citizens fed up with inequality in one of the region's wealthiest nations after violent protests in 2019. He pledged during the 2021 election campaign to \"bury\" the country's market-led economic model, though tempered his aims when he installed a market-friendly finance minister. But while Boric's environmental agenda and focus on inclusivity - women make up a majority of his Cabinet - have earned him plaudits, analysts said most voters were more focused on everyday matters. \"People want to make it to the end of the month, be able to buy a car, be certain their kids will prosper,\" said Cristobal Bellolio, a political analyst and professor at the University of Adolfo Ibanez in Santiago, the country's capital. Unrest between indigenous groups and authorities in southern Chile, where trucks have been burned and a train derailed, has also tested Boric. And in late March, about two weeks after the new president was sworn in, thousands of students demonstrated in Santiago to demand higher food stipends. One student was shot during the protest. \"Once you're in power, you realize that the carrot isn't enough,\" added Bellolio. \"Once the party was over and things went back to normal, it was logical that the themes of public safety were going to be a headache for the government.\" Giorgio Jackson, a minister and Boric confidant, told Reuters earlier in June that raising the minimum wage had been one of the government's biggest victories so far, and the next big push was tax reform, including for the mining sector.  read more  Chile also faces a key referendum in September on a new constitution to replace the existing market-centric one that dates back decades to the neo-liberal economic policies under military dictator Augusto Pinochet. While that process predates Boric, it underpins many of the ideas he is trying to push on social rights and the environment. Vallejo said the government was focused on holding a fair and transparent plebiscite and would push its agenda regardless of the outcome, though she added that the current constitution limits the administration's proposed reforms. \"We'll push with the same conviction we had when we took power,\" Vallejo said. \"Chile worked hard on this and we'd like to help show the world we can make deep changes.\"","153":"SANTIAGO, June 26 (Reuters) - Chilean state-owned copper miner Codelco, the world's top producer of the red metal, sees a firm copper price ahead despite a recent sharp fall, chairman of the board Máximo Pacheco told Reuters in an interview in Santiago. The comments come as copper prices posted their biggest weekly fall in a year as investors worried that efforts by central banks to stem inflation will stifle global economic growth and reduce demand for metals.  read more  \"We may be in temporary short-term turbulence, but what is important here are the fundamentals, the supply-demand balance looks very favorable to those of us who have copper reserves,\" Pacheco said. \"In a world where copper is the conductor par excellence and where there aren't many new deposits either, the price of copper looks very firm because the future looks very electric.\" Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was 0.5% lower at $8,367 a tonne on Friday after touching $8,122.50, down 25% from a peak in March and the lowest level since February 2021. Other industrial metals also tumbled. Pacheco, a former energy minister appointed earlier this year, said the annual production goal would be maintained at 1.7 million tonnes while he was in charge, including for this year. He said costs needed to be kept in check \"In this industry we compete with costs and that is why we need to be competitive,\" he said. Chile's government said this week it would allow Codelco, which gives all its profits to the state, to retain 30% of its profits from last year to help finance an ambitious $40 billion investment plan until the end of the decade. \"We have this portfolio of very large projects and the Chilean state decided to change the dividend policy precisely to be able to finance those strategic projects not only with depreciation and debt but also with reinvestment,\" he said. The executive said the injection of resources would allow the firm's debt to remain \"relatively stable,\" currently at some $18 billion, though it would still look for opportunities to go to debt markets to improve its maturity curve.","154":"SANTIAGO, June 23 (Reuters) - Union leaders at Chile's state-owned mining firm Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, reached an agreement with the company on Thursday to end a national strike over the decision to close a smelter located in a highly polluted area. The Federation of Copper Workers (FTC), an umbrella group of Codelco's unions, started the strike early Wednesday morning after Codelco's board of directors decided to close its Ventanas smelter on Friday.  read more  \"We're officially declaring the end of the strike,\" Amador Pantoja, president of the FTC said to reporters outside of Codelco's headquarters in Santiago after hours of negotiations, adding that strike leaders were already lifting blockades around the country. Workers had blocked roads outside Codelco facilities around the country, lit fires, and held up banners and Chilean flags calling for more investment in the smelter. After spending nearly $156 million over a decade to reduce emissions at the smelter, Codelco decided to close it due ongoing health concerns in the surrounding community, which is home to several industrial companies, citing the smelter's outdated technology which made it harder to curb emissions. About 350 people worked at the smelter. Thursday's agreement does not include more investment in the troubled Ventanas smelter, but it involved strengthening the Ventanas copper refinery, Pantoja said without elaborating. \"That lets us look forward with optimism and hope,\" Pantoja said. Andre Sougarret, Codelco's interim chief executive, said that the company was starting a working dialogue with workers starting Monday regarding the closure of the Ventanas smelter. \"We're with the workers; we plan on meeting their demands,\" Sougarret said, saying that retraining, relocation and exit packages were on the table for workers currently employed at the smelter. Closing the smelter will take years, according to Sougarret and the process is reliant on Congress modifying a law that forces the company to use the Ventanas smelter, which could take months. The smelter is located in a populated area filled with industrial companies and has been the site of multiple pollution incidents that have affected residents' health and prompted environmental emergencies, including one earlier this month that caused the Ventanas smelter to close.  read more ","155":"SANTIAGO, June 18 (Reuters) - Workers at Chilean state-owned miner Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, said on Saturday they will start preparations for a national strike after the firm announced the closure of the troubled Ventanas smelter.

On Friday the company instead chose to shut it down.  read more  The Federation of Copper Workers (FTC), which groups Codelco's unions, said it regretted that the firm had \"assumed exclusive responsibility for the environmental episodes in the Puchuncaví and Quintero area\" in an industrial coastal region. \"According to the agreement adopted with the support of our union bases, we will begin to prepare from this minute the national strike in all Codelco divisions,\" the FTC said in a statement, without giving more details. \"Our action will continue as long as the government and the Codelco Board of Directors insist on the closure of Ventanas and do not green light the resources to allow the Codelco smelters to continue as competitive and sustainable units.\" Codelco stopped work at the Ventanas smelter and refinery earlier in June to carry out maintenance after authorities declared an environmental emergency in the region.  read more  The closure will require the modification of a law that obliges Codelco to smelt minerals from the also state-owned Enami, coming from small and medium-sized mining, exclusively in Ventanas.

Workers had threatened action, including a strike, if the board did not invest to upgrade the facility after an environmental incident sickened dozens of people. The mining company stopped the smelter for maintenance and operational adjustments ordered by the environmental regulator after dozens of people fell ill in its saturated industrial location on the east coast.  read more  \"Codelco's board of directors approved by majority to advance in the preparation to cease the operation,\" the company said in a statement, adding that the associated copper refinery would not be affected. The company would help workers secure jobs, offering options such as relocation, retraining or special voluntary retirement plans to deal with the transition, it said. Ealier, a union source, who sought anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters about the decision before it was made public. Closing the smelter will require changes to a law that forces the company to smelt minerals from state-owned Enami, a company for small and medium-scale miners, exclusively at Ventanas. Leaders of the Federation of Copper Workers (FTC), which groups the firms' unions, told Reuters they were analysing the board's decision to assess their position. Codelco's gradual closure process will begin with temporary stoppage once the legal adjustment is approved, the firm, said. The unionized workers have insisted that Ventanas be fitted with some capsules that retain gases, at a cost of $53 million, in order to continue operations in compliance with environment rules. However, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando told congress this week that a complete upgrade of the unit could be as costly as building a new smelter.","157":"SANTIAGO, June 16 (Reuters) - Workers at Chile's state-owned Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, will go on strike if they do not receive a favorable answer from the company's board of directors Friday, the union said on Thursday. The union has insisted that Ventanas, in the central zone of the country where the smelter is located, needs $53 million worth of capsules to retain certain gases, allowing operations to continue while being environmentally compliant. \"The call of the Federation of Copper Workers is to remain united, alert and mobilized, to reach the promised NATIONAL STRIKE in case the decision that the Board of Directors of the Corporation should adopt (Friday) is not favorable to the achievement of this long-awaited higher goal,\" the union said in a statement. \"We are fully aware that the announcement of guaranteeing the investments that Ventanas requires is a decision that Codelco's Board of Directors must urgently make,\" it added. In a congressional session Wednesday, Chile Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said that the studies needed to improve the unit have already been carried out, but that the decision falls on the state company's board of directors, which has autonomous corporate governance.  read more  The company has not responded to the workers' demands nor to the threat of a work stoppage.

Giorgio Jackson, a former student leader alongside Boric and now his Minister Secretary-General of the Presidency, said tax adjustments were a key focus, essential to raising funds to pay for overhauling social programs from education to health. \"On June 30 we are going to make the announcement of the entire tax reform and we are going to start with a couple of bills immediately. One of them is the mining royalty,\" he said late last week at his office in La Moneda, the presidential palace. He added tax reform was a \"necessary condition\" to make the changes 36-year-old Boric's leftist government had promised when he came into office in March, though a separate mining royalty plan that builds upon a bill currently making its way through congress is also key. \"For us that's a priority, probably number one,\" he said. Boric, approaching 100 days in office, won strong support in an election last year but has seen his popularity tumble amid high inflation and ongoing social unrest including in the country's south and questions over migration in the north. Jackson said the tax reforms would \"boost\" Chile on par with other mineral-rich nations, bringing funds to support research and development of new growth areas for the world's top copper producer and the second largest producer of lithium. \"There is an opportunity Chile has with copper, with lithium, to use them and imagine a different productive system,\" he said. He admitted that tax reforms were never an easy sell, especially with inflation in the Andean country at its highest since the 1990s and economic growth expected to only grow weakly this year despite soaring global metals prices. \"When you're in a bonanza and good times or in bad times, they always say why are you going to do it now?\" he said. \"There's never a good time to do tax reform.\" Chile is also in the process of overhauling its market-orientated Constitution which dates back to the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. That process, which stemmed from social protests in 2019, has been hit as support for the new document has dwindled, with the risk it could fail to pass. Jackson said that \"unnecessary controversies\" through the process had left some people disillusioned, but hoped support would pick up again once the draft was finalized in July. The final referendum vote is in September.","159":"SANTIAGO, June 15 (Reuters) - Workers at Chilean state-owned Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, maintained the threat of a strike on Wednesday if a solution was not reached on investments required by a troubled smelter.

During the session, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said that the investment studies necessary to improve the unit's performance have already been carried out, but that the decisions rest with the mining company's board. \"We have announced very responsibly through the networks, through the press, and we have said it clearly: If the situation is not resolved, we are going to start a strike and please, I do not want them to see it as a threat because it is not a threat,\" Amado Pantoja, head of the Federation of Copper Workers (FTC), said during the session. \"We all know, those of us who have been leaders, that strikes are not announced, strikes are made, but what we want to tell you is that the most important company in Chile is at risk.\" Pantoja said that Ventanas, the area in central Chile where the smelter is located, needs $53 million capsules that retain gases and would allow operations to continue while being environmentally compliant.

Water for only two pools now remains. A huge expanse of dried and cracked earth that was once the lake bed is littered with fish skeletons and desperate animals searching for water. Amid an historic 13-year drought, rainfall levels have slumped in this South American nation that hugs the continent's Pacific coast. Higher air temperatures have meant snow in the Andes, once a key store of meltwater for spring and summer, is not compacting, melts faster, or turns straight to vapor. The drought has hit mine output in the world's largest copper producer, stoked tensions over water use for lithium and farming, and led capital Santiago to make unprecedented plans for potential water rationing. \"We have to beg God to send us water,\" said Amanda Carrasco, a 54-year-old who lives near the Penuelas reservoir and recalls line fishing in the waters for local pejerrey fish. \"I've never seen it like this. There's been less water before, but not like now.\" The reservoir needs rainfall - once reliable in winter but now at historic lows, said Jose Luis Murillo, general manager of ESVAL, the company that supplies Valparaiso with water. \"Basically what we have is just a puddle,\" he said, adding that the city now relied on rivers. \"This is especially significant if you think that several decades ago the Penuelas reservoir was the only source of water for all greater Valparaiso.\" Behind the issue, academic studies have found, is a global shift in climate patterns sharpening natural weather cycles. Normally, low-pressure storms from the Pacific unload precipitation over Chile in winter, recharging aquifers and packing the Andes mountains with snow. But naturally occurring warming of the sea off Chile's coast, which blocks storms from arriving, has been intensified by rising global sea temperature, according to a global study on sea temperature and rainfall deficits. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gasses in the Antarctic, meanwhile, exacerbate weather patterns that draw storms away from Chile, according to a study on variables affecting Antarctic weather. Analysis of tree rings going back 400 years shows how rare the current drought is, said Duncan Christie, a researcher at the Center for Climate and Resilience in Chile. It is totally unrivalled for duration or intensity. He said that meant the Andes - which he called the country's \"water towers\" - were not getting a chance to replenish, which in turn meant that as snow melted in spring there was far less water to fill rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Miguel Lagos, a civil engineer and water specialist, traveled to measure snow cover near the Laguna Negra station in central Chile some 50 kilometers (31 miles) east of Santiago - part of a process to estimate summer water supply. \"There was just nothing,\" he told Reuters. \"There were so few precipitation events and such warm conditions that the snow melted that same winter.\" As snow compacts, creating new layers, this helps keep it colder for longer. But with warmer weather and less snowfall, Lagos said, top layers of snow were melting faster or turning straight to vapor, a process called sublimation. A 2019 study in the International Journal of Climatology that analyzed Chile's drought from 2010 to 2018 said shifting weather events could ease the drought in future, but much would depend on the trajectory of human emissions impacting climate. Segundo Aballay, an animal breeder in the Chilean village of Montenegro, is praying change comes soon. \"If it doesn't rain this year we will be left with nothing to do,\" he said. \"The animals are getting weaker and dying day by day.\" Unfortunately for agriculture workers like Aballay, researchers at the University of Chile predict the country will have 30% less water over the next 30 years, based on mathematical models and historic data. \"What we call a drought today will become normal,\" Lagos said. In the Laguna de Aculeo, another dried up lake south of Santiago, local campsite manager Francisco Martinez recalled hundreds of people coming to the area to take out kayaks or swim in the waters. Now rusting piers and old boats sit in the barren landscape. An eerie island in the middle of what was once water rises up above the dust. \"Now there is no water, it is a desert here,\" Martinez told Reuters. \"The animals are dying and there is nothing to do here in the lagoon any more.\"","161":"June 10 (Reuters) - Ecuador will play at the 2022 World Cup after FIFA dismissed Chile's claims that they had fielded an ineligible player in the qualifiers, world soccer's governing body said on Friday. The Chilean Football Federation (ANFP) last month said it had proof that Ecuador's Byron Castillo was born in Tumaco, Colombia in 1995, and not in the Ecuadorean city of General Villamil Playas in 1998 as stated on his official documents. It claimed the Barcelona of Guayaquil full back, who played in eight of Ecuador's 18 qualifying games for Qatar, used a false passport and birth certificate. \"After analysing the submissions of all parties concerned and considering all elements brought before it, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee has decided to close the proceedings initiated against the FEF (Ecuadorean Football Association),\" it said in a statement. \"The present decision remains subject to an appeal before the FIFA Appeal Committee.\" Ecuador picked up 14 of their 26 points in matches Castillo played. If they had lost points for the games in which Castillo appeared, they would have missed out on a place in Qatar. Ecuador are one of four South American teams who have already qualified for the World Cup finals later this year, along with Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Fifth-placed Peru face a playoff next week. \"Today sporting justice has been done,\" FEF president Francisco Egas wrote on Twitter. \"We always knew we were on the right side, let's go Ecuador!\" Egas also attached the letter from FIFA which said the Disciplinary Committee had dismissed the charges and closed the disciplinary procedure initiated against the FEF. Chile finished seventh in qualifying with 19 points. However, the Chilean FA's lawyer Eduardo Carlezzo had said that if Chile were given the points from the two games against Ecuador in which Castillo played they would have gone to the World Cup in their place. \"We celebrate it more because we felt humiliated, we felt trampled by the great media campaign from the Chilean federation,\" Egas said later at a news conference. \"Especially their lawyer, who put forward a version that doubted the actions of the Ecuadorian soccer federation and also doubted the actions of our authorities.\" ANFP president Pablo Milad said they would appeal and even take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if required. \"We are losing 1-0, but there is still the second half,\" Milad said at a news conference with Carlezzo. \"The FIFA ruling surprisingly did not favour us despite strong evidence. We will wait for the arguments and we will appeal to FIFA. If it does not favour us, we will go to CAS.\" Ecuador are in Group A alongside hosts Qatar, Senegal and the Netherlands.

Voters said the main reasons for approving the constitution are feelings that the country needs \"changes\" and more social rights and justice. The main reasons given for rejecting it are the constituents in charge of drafting the new text themselves and their work. Others simply disagree with the new constitution. Undecided voters said the main reason for their indecision is a lack of information. The current draft text is being fine tuned and a final text is due early July. The plebiscite will be on September 4.

The U.S. decision, announced earlier on Monday, was taken due to concerns about human rights and a lack of democracy in the three nations, according to a senior official in the administration of President Joe Biden.  read more  Talking to reporters in Ottawa, Boric said the U.S. move was \"reinforcing the position that these other countries take in their own countries. We think it's an error, a mistake, and we're going to say that during the summit.\" Boric, a leftist and former student protest leader who took power in March, was speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the two signed a memorandum to coordinate efforts to advance gender equality and empower women. Boric is scheduled to head to the summit after his Canada visit. Boric's comment was the latest rebuke from a Latin American leader, highlighting how some are pursuing an increasingly independent foreign policy from Washington.  read more  Earlier, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would not attend the summit because not all countries from the region were invited. Trudeau did not say whether or not he disagreed with the exclusion, but said Canada looked forward to participating fully in the summit. \"It's extremely important that we have an opportunity to engage with our fellow hemispheric partners, some like-minded, some less like-minded, but talking about important issues that our people have in common,\" he said.","165":"SANTIAGO, June 1 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric struck a conciliatory tone and outlined his government's plans to tackle a slew of issues amid a sharp drop in his approval rating during his first State of the Union Address on Wednesday. Emphasizing the need for all Chileans to work together to address issues from safety to tax reform, Boric also spoke neutrally about the new constitution, for which support has dwindled. \"On September 4 we'll have a transcendental decision: approve or reject the proposal of a new constitution,\" he said. \"Both options are legitimate.\" The comments marked a shift from the firebrand candidate and former student protest leader who vowed Chile would be the \"grave\" of neoliberalism during the 2021 election. Wearing his signature suit and no tie, Boric promised a 40-hour work week, the right to euthanasia and investment in infrastructure, education, health, housing, sports and culture. The president also said the government would submit a law to reform the country's controversial private pension system in August. \"The time has come to build a true social security system,\" Boric said, committing to guaranteeing a monthly pension of 250,000 pesos ($303) to citizens over 65 and emphasizing that current private pensions would be protected. He said he will present a new tax reform bill to Congress this month, saying \"the country cannot wait.\" \"Our tax reform will attack the bases of inequality,\" Boric said, adding it would tax high incomes, estates and mining income. Regarding mining in the world's top copper producing nation, Boric reiterated the need to create a national lithium company and said Codelco, the state-owned mining company, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 64%, freshwater consumption by 42% and recycle 55% of industrial waste by 2026. \"We believe in responsible mining that's constantly improving socio-environmental standards,\" Boric said. To strengthen copper mining, Boric said Codelco will invest $90 million in exploration and $86 million for innovation. The president also said he planned to reform the police system and invest in security to tackle rising criminality and drug trafficking.","166":"May 26 (Reuters) - Chile on Thursday appointed experienced Argentine Eduardo Berizzo as their new national coach following the team's failure to make this year's World Cup finals. Berizzo replaces Martin Lasarte, who was sacked in April after Chile missed out on the finals that begin in Qatar in November. The 52-year-old Berizzo began his coaching career as an assistant to then Chile manager Marcelo Bielsa in 2007. He has coached since at Argentine club Estudiantes, Sevilla and Athletic in Spain, and he most recently led Paraguay during most of their unsuccessful bid to qualify for Qatar. He was given a four-year contract in Santiago and will be charged with getting Chile back on track after missing out on both the World Cup in Russia in 2018 and this year's tournament. His first games in charge will come next month when Chile play South Korea and Tunisia. \"Dear fans of our national football team, we have a coach and he is Eduardo Berizzo,\" said Pablo Milad, the president of the Chilean Football Federation. \"He knows our football and he has vast international experience.

Pereira had birdied on the par-four 18 the day before and told reporters he believed he would win his maiden major title on the hole Sunday. But he instead sent the ball into the water, ultimately settling for a double-bogey and finishing the day with a disastrous five-over 75, as eventual winner Justin Thomas of the United States advanced to a playoff against compatriot Will Zalatoris. Pereira finished the tournament tied for third with American Cameron Young. \"I thought I was nervous the first day,\" Pereira said. \"Then I thought I was nervous the second day. Then I thought I was nervous on the third day but the fourth day was terrible. I mean, this morning was tough. \"I just played it through, and actually had a one-shot lead on 18 and that was pretty good and sad to hit it in the water. I mean, I wish I could do it again.\" The 27-year-old previously picked up three wins on the Korn Ferry Tour but has yet to clinch a PGA Tour title. Three shots clear at the top of the leaderboard through the first three rounds, Pereira was the first Chilean to lead a major but his Sunday shakes showed early with three bogeys on the front nine. He told reporters that he tried to get a handle on his nerves, but simply could not find his composure in his second major appearance in front of a raucous Tulsa crowd. \"You're in such a stressful situation that, I mean, everything can change. Just got to learn how to do it better. Keep like training for it,\" he said. \"(It) was a tough day.\"","168":"TULSA, Oklahoma, May 21 (Reuters) - Unheralded Mito Pereira became the first Chilean to lead a major, surging three shots clear at the top of the PGA Championship third round leaderboard on Saturday, while Tiger Woods withdrew after sinking to the bottom of table. Playing in just his second major, Pereira has refused to surrender to pressure carding a one-under 69 to get to nine-under 201 and a three-shot advantage on Britain's Matt Fitzpatrick and American Will Zalatoris going into Sunday's final round at Southern Hills Country Club. Woods has played nearly 100 majors and won 15, but the PGA Championship in Southern Hills was just the second in his comeback from a car crash 15 months ago that nearly resulted in the amputation of his right leg. The toll that effort was taken reached a head on Saturday as a hobbled Woods grimaced his way to a nine-over 79, his third worst score ever at a major. The dejected 46-year-old trudged off the 18th green with the PGA of America confirming five hours later he had withdrawn. \"Tiger Woods has informed us that he is withdrawing from the 2022 PGA Championship,\" PGA of America President Jim Richerson said in a statement. \"We admire Tiger’s valiant effort to compete here at Southern Hills and wish him the best as he continues to recover from his injuries.” With Woods long gone, Pereira started his work one back but found himself alone at the top after two holes when overnight leader Zalatoris bogeyed the first and he picked up a birdie at the second. The 27-year-old would extend his lead to four before a mid-round wobble that saw him absorb four bogeys over a five-hole stretch around the turn. But with his lead chopped to one, Pereira responded with back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14 before closing out his round in style, rolling in 27-footer at the last. \"It's by far the biggest tournament I played, the biggest round of golf and tomorrow is going to be even bigger,\" said Pereira, who missed the cut in his only other major the 2019 U.S. Open. I just try to keep it simple, try to do the same things that I've been doing, try to not even look at the people that's around me.\" When the day began Fitzpatrick was heading in the wrong direction with bogeys on his opening two holes but would have just one the rest of the way while notching six birdies, including a pair to end his round for a 67. Second round leader Zalatoris never managed to heat up on a cold day in Oklahoma, taking four bogeys on his outward nine on was to a three-over 73. Cameron Young also had a 67 to lurk four off the lead. Pereira, Fitzpatrick, Zalatoris and Young are all in pursuit of their first PGA Tour win. After dealing with heat and gusting winds through the opening two rounds, golfers faced dramatically different conditions on Saturday as rain and cold settled in over Tulsa. With temperatures hovering around 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), players sweated out a wind-whipped second round, but on Saturday with temperatures in the 50s (10-15C) mitts, sweaters and umbrellas were the order of the day. First round leader Rory McIlroy's hopes of ending an eight-year major drought faded as the Northern Irishman was dragged down the leaderboard with a four-over 74, falling nine back of the leader. McIlroy, a two-time winner of the PGA Championship, was far from the only big name to labour in the miserable conditions. U.S. Open champion and world number two Jon Rahm slumped to a 76 while British Open winner and world number three Collin Morikawa signed for a 74.","169":"TULSA, Okla., May 20 (Reuters) - Chile's Mito Pereira said it was the best thing he'd ever done when he secured a PGA Tour card last year. He may soon top that as he heads into the weekend one shot off the PGA Championship lead and with a chance to become his country's first player to win a major. Pereira, one of a record six Latin American players in the field this week at Southern Hills Country Club, tied his career-low round on the PGA Tour with a six-under-par 64 that brought him to eight under on the week, one shot back of Will Zalatoris. After storming up the leaderboard the 27-year-old Pereira was asked what he would have said if, back when he took a two-year break from golf when he was a teenager, someone told him he would be contending to win a major \"That you're crazy,\" said Pereira. \"No, I mean, I took the two years off but when I came back I just -- I knew I could do it, I knew I could get to here, and I just kept the confidence, and obviously there were some up and downs but really happy to be here.\" Last June, Pereira secured his third Korn Ferry Tour title of the 2020-21 season, which made him only the 12th player in the development circuit's 32-year history to earn the three-victory promotion to the PGA Tour. He now wants to make the most of his opportunity. Competing in only his second major and first since missing the cut at the 2019 U.S. Open, Pereira was a picture of calm in windy conditions that got the better of many more experienced golfers. Starting on the back nine, he birdied his first two holes before carding his only bogey of the day at the par-four 12th where he failed to get up and down from 36 yards away. But Pereira, who has three career PGA Tour top 10s, marched on and drained a 21-foot birdie putt at his seventh hole before making the turn and kicking things up a few notches. He carded four more birdies over a six-hole stretch on his back nine, including one at the par-four seventh where he drained a six-foot putt to grab a share of the lead but ended up one back after Zalatoris birdied his penultimate hole. \"The conditions are going to change a little bit. The wind is going to change. Going to be a little bit colder. I think I'll just try to do the same I've been doing,\" Pereira said of the weekend. \"Been hitting the ball really well, so I think that's a real strength coming up to the weekend.

Residents of the island protested the presence of tourists when the pandemic started in March 2020, even taking over the airport to stop flights from the mainland. To reopen the island, the government has started an official dialogue to \"find a solution to the territorial conflict that has existed for over 50 years\" between the local community and the state, it said in the statement To start the dialogue, the government agreed to implement reparation and historical recognition measures while residents agreed to stop occupying the airport.","171":"SANTIAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - Chile's top court on Wednesday turned down appeals filed by communities and environmentalists against the controversial Dominga mining project, saying a final decision needs input from President Gabriel Boric's administration. Last year, environmentalists and surrounding communities appealed a ruling from a lower court that tossed out a decision by a regulator that denied the company permits. In its ruling, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court said that it was turning down the appeals because it \"determined that there is no final judgment that can be reviewed by this court,\" adding that the final decision on the environmental evaluation is \"pending a resolution from the administrative authority.\" That authority is the committee of ministers, made up of the mining, agriculture, energy, economy, health ministers and is chaired environment minister. In his first speech as president-elect in December, Boric voiced opposition to projects that \"destroy\" the country, such as Dominga, which seeks to annually produce 12 million tonnes of iron concentrate and 150,000 tonnes of copper concentrate. An environmental evaluation commission endorsed the $2.5 billion project last year, but it has been delayed for years amid strong opposition from environmental and social groups that say it would cause serious environmental damage to the region. OceanaChile, an environmental group dedicated to protecting the ocean, has said the project could hurt the Humboldt archipelago off Chile's coast, endangering its species and biodiversity. \"Our trust is in that the Committee of Ministers will consider all the scientific information that backs why Dominga is unviable and the Humboldt archipelago must be protected permanently,\" it said in a tweet responding to the decision. Andes Iron, the company in charge of the Dominga project, issued a statement saying it welcomed the court's decision and added that \"every time the Dominga project has undergone technical evaluations we have received favorable pronouncements.\" The project has spanned multiple administrations and sparked controversies for former presidents Michelle Bachelet and Sebastian Pinera.

The constitutional assembly finished approving new articles over the weekend, with a total of 499 given the green light since the debate began last October. The harmonization commission will be in charge of consolidating and fine-tuning the text, another will be in charge of writing an introductory text and a third will establish a framework to transition from one constitution to the next. \"We haven't been exempt from mistakes, of course, but today we can say we fulfiled the mandate Chilean's gave us on time and in substance,\" said Maria Elisa Quinteros, president of the constitutional assembly. \"We've handed in this draft of a constitution that was drafted completely democratically for the first time in our history.\" Speaking from the Huanchaca ruins in the northern city of Antofagasta on Monday evening, Quinteros emphasized the draft's focus on decentralizing power and a new phase where the assembly will work form different regions around the country. \"Our presence is an opportunity to meet with people usually distanced from places where decisions are made,\" Quinteros said, adding that it was also an chance for the assembly to present and explain the new constitution around the country. In late 2020, citizens overwhelmingly voted to draft the new constitution after violent protests against inequality erupted across the country. The proposed document, which citizens will vote to approve or reject on Sept 4., expands social rights and is a sharp turn from the current market-friendly charter that dates back to the Augusto Pinochet-era dictatorship. \"With these norms and articles we'll start building a more just Chile with rights to education, housing, work and social security,\" Quinteros said. \"This text depicts a new way of relating to each other, a new way of understanding life in our country, where everyone can feel protected.\" The draft magna carta also increases autonomy for indigenous territories, expands environmental rights and makes fighting climate change a constitutional duty for the state. Additionally, the text reforms Chile's political system, including allowing immediate presidential re-election and replaces the senate with a new \"chamber of regions\". Public support for the new document has fallen sharply over the past weeks, with voters intending to reject the new constitution surpassing those planning to approve it for the first time in early April.

Article 25, which states that miners must set aside \"resources to repair damage\" to the environment and harmful effects where mining takes place, did get a supermajority and will be in the draft constitution. The assembly also approved banning mining in glaciers, protected areas and those essential to protecting the water system. Articles guaranteeing farmers and indigenous people the right to traditional seeds, the right to safe and accessible energy and protection of oceans and the atmosphere were also approved. Voting to approve articles concludes after Saturday's votes, and new commissions in charge of fine-tuning the text take over on Monday. The final draft is due in early July and citizens will vote to approve or reject it on Sept. 4. The environmental commission, dominated by self-proclaimed eco-constituents, saw just one of 40 of its proposals approved during their first votes in the general assembly.

The Salares Norte gold project, the company's largest, is set to start producing in the first quarter of next year, and labour shortages around the project have forced Gold Fields to create parallel work streams. \"That kind of inflation is what is rapidly eating up our contingency,\" Griffith said in an interview on the sidelines of the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town. Cost inflation is a headache for all mining companies that are heavy consumers of fuel and electricity. Prices for some products Gold Fields consumes, such as steel bolts, reagents, and explosives, have risen by as much as 30%, Griffith said. Overall, though, Gold Fields is a net beneficiary of inflation, Griffith said, as the gold price tends to rise in lockstep with price rises. Although gold prices spiked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, they have fallen back significantly since. Gold Fields is also facing a \"nervous time\" in Chile as the country continues the process of rewriting its constitution, Griffith said. Chile's constitutional assembly passed articles expanding environmental rights on Saturday, but stopped short of approving a proposal to give the state exclusive mining rights over lithium, hydrocarbons and rare earth metals and majority ownership of copper mines.  read more  Griffith said countries' demands for higher taxes are also becoming a bigger concern for the company, particularly in Peru, Chile, and Ghana.

Hichilema said Zambia aims to avoid another debt default after it became in 2020 the first country in the pandemic era to default on its debt. \"The overall approach is to rein in on the debt, which starts with ceasing to borrow recklessly going forward, especially not borrow at high cost,\" Hichilema said during an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town. \"Now that we have this common framework ... we are seeking a reduction in the debt as part of the package. Everything is on the table,\" he said. Zambia, Africa's second-biggest copper producer, is struggling to jumpstart its economy as it grapples with a debt load reaching 120% of GDP. Since Hichilema's election last August, Zambia has implemented business-friendly reforms and investor sentiment has improved, with the kwacha currency increasing in value against the dollar. Zambia's debt totalled $31.74 billion at the end of 2021, according to official government data - of which $17.27 billion was external debt. China held $5.78 billion of the external debt. The first meeting of the creditor committee is expected to take place next week, Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane told Reuters in the same interview. He reiterated that debt talks should end in June, a timeline analysts consider ambitious. Musokotwane had said previously that debt negotiations were \"stalled\" at International Monetary Fund meetings last month, after Zambia secured a staff-level agreement on a $1.4 billion three-year credit facility with the fund in December.

The Andean nation, the world's no. 1 copper producer and the no. 2 producer of battery metal lithium, is battling a historic drought that is now entering its 13th year. That has led capital Santiago to roll out unprecedented plans to ration water for residents.  read more  Mines are also feeling the effects. Anglo American's (AAL.L) flagship Los Bronces mine in central Chile saw production fall 17% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022, partly due to water scarcity, the firm said in April. Antofagasta Minerals (ANTO.L) said drought led to a 24% first-quarter drop in production at its Los Pelambres mine. Tensions over water use having been building over years for Chile's miners, who need it for pumping minerals like lithium to the surface, copper smelting, and in the concentrator, which breaks down raw ore and processes it into usable material. Traditionally, they have relied on continental waters - land-based water from lakes, rivers and reservoirs. \"Our main challenge is to find other sources beyond continental waters,\" Maximo Pacheco, chairman of state-owned mining giant Codelco, told Reuters. Pacheco said Codelco was planning to recycle more water and reduce water use through efficiency savings, but gave few details on specific measures. Mining firms such as Anglo American and Antofagasta have targeted tailings of mine waste to increase recirculation, reduced water loss from pipes, and reused greywater. In Los Pelambres in the northern region of Coquimbo, mine workers are reminded as they eat their lunch to reduce personal water use by screens around the dining room, part of the mine's \"Every Drop Counts\" program to save water. Antofagasta's mine also has a desalination plant coming online in the second half of the year and is targeting 90% of the mine's water coming from the ocean or recirculation by 2025. Jorge Cantallopts, head of research at government copper commission Cochilco, told Reuters that mines high up in the Andes in central Chile were facing the biggest challenge, with the drought likely to persist and issues creating desalination plants far from the ocean. Cantallopts pointed to Los Bronces as the most notable example, but said others like Codelco's Andina and El Teniente could soon confront similar issues. \"They will face the same problems in a few years and we have to do something,\" he said. Mining undersecretary Willy Kracht told Reuters the government was pushing mining firms to share water infrastructure and plans to establish a forum to boost coordination. Anglo American said in response to Reuters queries that Los Bronces was looking to make production more efficient and find water sources that \"don't compete with human consumption.\" The firm has already increased water efficiency and reduced freshwater extraction, though it has warned its copper production projections of 660,000 to 750,000 tonnes this year could be affected by water availability and COVID-19 impacts. Water use is also becoming increasingly political, with leftist President Gabriel Boric keen to toughen environmental regulations. Regulators have already looked to sue or fine some mining firms for excess water use, especially in the Atacama desert region, a major source of lithium which is in hot demand to make electric vehicle batteries.  read more  Cochilco estimates fresh water use will decline by 45% by 2032 due to desalination, according to a report last month. But the process is expensive, uses lots of electricity, and is not always feasible in high-altitude Andean regions inland. BHP Group (BHP.AX), an early mover, now meets water demand at its huge Escondida mine with the technology and has a desalination plant at its Spence mine, but still depends on continental waters for the smaller Cerro Colorado deposit. Antofagasta has said that the continuity of its Zaldivar mine depends on the extension of continental water rights since its size would not justify the cost of a desalination plant. Kracht said protecting water resources and the environment and spurring economic growth in the mining-dependent country was a tough balancing act. \"We have to take care of this drought. Then there's climate change and policies being promoted at a global level, but we are also being tasked to develop more mining. So there is a kind of contradiction we have to learn how to balance,\" he said.","180":"May 5 (Reuters) - The Chilean Football Federation on Thursday asked FIFA to rule on the eligibility of an Ecuador player, alleging he used a false passport and birth certificate and throwing into question the Andean side’s participation in this year's World Cup. Chile said it had proof that Barcelona of Guayaquil full back Byron Castillo was born in Tumaco, Colombia, in 1995 and not in the Ecuadorean city of General Villamil Playas in 1998 as stated on his official papers. Documents used in the filing to FIFA and seen by Reuters purport to show his \"forged\" birth certificates as well as an internal Ecuadorean investigation acknowledging inconsistencies in his documentation. \"All this is obviously well known by the FEF (Ecuadorean Federation),\" the Chilean federation said in a statement. \"The football world cannot close its eyes to so much proof. These serious and irregular practices in the registration of players cannot be accepted, especially when we are talking about a world competition.\" It said it had sent evidence to FIFA asking it to investigate. FIFA acknowledged it had \"received a formal complaint from the Chilean FA\" but declined to comment further. Reports from Ecuador in 2021 said Castillo had been ratified as an Ecuadorean citizen, enabling him to play for the national side. Castillo made his debut five months after that decision, which was reported in the newspaper El Telegrafo. The Ecuadorean FA dismissed on Thursday what it said were \"unfounded rumours\" designed to destabilise the Ecuadorean Football Federation by those who want to prevent its participation in the Qatar World Cup. \"We must be emphatic (and state) that Byron Castillo is Ecuadorean for all legal effects,\" a statement said. Castillo’s possible ineligibility could spell trouble for Ecuador, one of four South American teams who have so far qualified for the Qatar World Cup in November and December. Castillo played in eight of Ecuador’s 18 qualifiers, matches in which they picked up 14 of their 26 points. The Andean side finished fourth in the 10-team qualifying table, the last automatic qualifying spot. If they lost points for the games in which Castillo appeared they could miss out on a place in Qatar. Chile finished seventh with 19 points but Eduardo Carlezzo, a lawyer for the Chilean FA, said if Chile were given the points from the two games against Ecuador in which Castillo played they would go to the World Cup in their place. \"Chile should get the points and thus move into fourth place,\" Carlezzo said. \"The amount of proof we have is incredible.\" The dispute is the second in consecutive World Cup qualifying campaigns involving Chile. In the run-up to the 2018 tournament in Russia, Bolivia were punished for fielding an ineligible player against Chile and Peru, with both sides awarded 3-0 wins. The points made no difference to Chile, who did not qualify, but they were crucial to Peru, who reached their first World Cup since 1982.","181":"MEXICO CITY, May 3 (Reuters) - Mexico is working with governments of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile to create a lithium association so the countries can share their expertise to exploit the battery mineral, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. \"We're going to work. We're already doing so together on development, on exploration, processing, new technologies,\" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. Bolivia, Chile and Argentina sit atop the so-called \"lithium triangle,\" a region containing nearly 56% of the world's resources of the metal, according to the most recent figures from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Mexico has no commercial lithium production but boasts potential deposits that if proven economically viable, could catapult it to major producer status. Last month, its Congress passed a bill to nationalize the metal, tightening control of strategic mineral resources, with Lopez Obrador saying he would review all contracts to exploit the metal. Close to a dozen foreign companies in Mexico hold active mining concessions, including permission to prospect for lithium, including the country's most advanced project Bacanora Lithium, which is controlled by Chinese firm Ganfeng Lithium Co (002460.SZ). A branch of the International Chamber of Commerce has argued that the law nationalizing the country's future lithium industry violates trade obligations and could prove costly to the government if mining companies seek to recoup losses.  read more  The metal is going through a price boom since the start of last year amid a global push toward electric modes of transportation, driving huge demand from carmakers and battery firms to shore up supply. \"Chile already participates in Latin American initiatives for cooperation in the exchange of knowledge, experiences, science and technology, and in this sense, we are willing to participate in initiatives that bring our peoples closer together,\" Chilean Mining Minister Marcela Hernando told Reuters. Chile has the third largest lithium reserves globally and is the second biggest producer, while neighboring Bolivia has hardly any production despite having larger resources than any other country, according to USGS data. For its part Argentina holds the spot of fourth top producer of lithium worldwide and is looking to speed up development, held back for years by red tape, high tax rates, rampant inflation and currency controls.  read more ","182":"April 29 (Reuters) - Chilean state-owned mining company Codelco is optimistic about copper prices for 2022 boosted by higher demand, its president Maximo Pacheco said on Friday during a press conference. Pacheco, who spoke after a meeting with shareholders and Finance Minister Mario Marcel and Mining Minister Marcela Hernando, said the optimism stems from a global trend towards renewable energy transformation, in which copper is an essential metal. \"We know that electrification and energy transition is a tendency that's going to be maintained as a result of the reality of climate change and global warming,\" Pacheco said. However, Pacheco and the ministers added that there are challenges for the company such as reducing its production costs, while promoting a project portfolio of $40 billion in \"structural projects\". \"Both factors are going to help increase Codelco's contribution to structural income from mining,\" Marcel said, noting that higher copper prices would also help. Hernando, the country's mining minister, said she was happy with economic results, but took aim at some private companies. \"We are happy with the economic results but we are also aware that there are many challenges and that most of them have to do with improving the cost structure,\" Hernando said. \"We are having a bad behavior regarding other companies in the industry.\" Pacheco also said the government is trying to find a way in which Codelco, which gives its profits to the state, can count on resources from its profits to meet investment needs. Until now, the company is mostly financed with depreciation and debt. \"We need to review this criterion to see how the shareholder, in this case the Chilean state, can reinvest part of the profits in the same company to sustain the projects,\" Pacheco said.","183":"SANTIAGO, April 28 (Reuters) - A group of unidentified individuals on Thursday set fire to two dozen trucks and machinery in Chile's southern Araucania region that for years has been marked by conflicts between the government and the Mapuche ethnic group. The incident occurred at Empresa de Camiones y Aridos Transa, a firm that provides services to the forestry industry and extracts aggregates for construction. It was the second time the firm had been the victim of an attack. Arauco provincial delegate Humberto Toro told local radio Cooperativa that more than 25 of the company's machines and trucks were burned. Last month, Interior Minister Izkia Siches's visit to the restive region of Araucania was interrupted by gunshots near her motorcade, forcing her to temporarily take shelter in a police station.  read more  Siches's visit was to start a dialogue to address conflicts in Araucania between authorities and local Mapuche indigenous groups in the southern region. The Mapuche have for years demanded the return of their ancestral lands, which were handed over to the private sector that exploits the land in the lucrative forestry sector. In recent years, attacks that include the burning of houses, trucks and machinery have intensified in the area. \"The attack in Los Alamos, Los Rios sector, shows that the province of Arauco is a lawless land,\" the Chilean National Confederation of Truck Owners (CNDC) said in a statement. The CNDC argued authorities are \"completely overwhelmed.\" The perpetrators left slogans at the site of the latest attack demanding freedom for \"Mapuche political prisoners,\" local radio reported.

The current monthly minimum wage stands at 350,000 pesos ($413), and the agreement bumps it to 380,000 pesos ($448)starting May 1, and 400,000 pesos ($472) starting Aug. 1. The agreement includes a special clause to raise the minimum wage to 410,000 pesos in January 2023 if the 12-month inflation rate in December exceeds 7%. Like many countries around the world and in the region, Chile has been dealing with soaring prices, posting in March its highest monthly inflation rate since 1993.  read more  In a news release, the government said the 14.3% hike in minimum wage was the largest in 25 years. The plan also includes subsidies and benefits for basic food items to help mitigate the effect of inflation on poorer families. \"We thank the leaders (of CUT) for their willingness to find a good point of agreement,\" said Labor Minister Jeannette Jara, adding that the agreement not only helps the country's 800,000 minimum wage workers, but also those who rely on basic basket subsidies. The proposal will go to congress later in the week. Legislators recently voted down dueling proposals, including one from President Gabriel Boric's government, for early pension withdrawal to help workers battling inflation and economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement said it would also establish an official group to start negotiating and designing a way to reduce Chile's workweek from 48 hours to 40 hours. \"We've made great progress today in the protection of rights, we've started building a real dialogue,\" said CUT president David Acuna.","185":"SANTIAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - Chile's constitutional convention rejected on Thursday night a set of proposals focused on expanding environmental protections, especially around the major mining sector, a blow to reformers which will push the articles back to committees to be reworked. \"Regretfully, our commission's [full proposal] was rejected,\" Camila Zarate, an environmental commission coordinator, told reporters after the vote. \"We regret that [the assembly] gave its back to citizens, communities, the population and territories that have been mobilizing for years to make these great changes in this constitutional text.\" Juan Jose Martin, the other commission coordinator, said he regretted that the entire set of proposals was voted down because it gave the commission no feedback about which proposals constituents objected to. Martin Arrau, a constituent and civil engineer who previously led a water reform campaign, said he voted against the proposals because he thought some would hinder growth and others were outside the constitutional jurisdiction. \"When it comes to the hydrological sources, basins, they have to be regulated by law and public policy, not in the constitution,\" Arrau told Reuters after the vote. \"If not, how are we going to have judicial and public frameworks that adapt to the variability of water sources?\" The debate started at 12 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) andfor more than six hours constituents gave impassioned speeches about environmental rights, the damage caused by extractive activities like mining and forestry, and the effects of Chile's historic drought throughout the country. Constituents were expected to vote on 52 articles including protecting water sources, glaciers and wetlands well into the night. But when voting started, constituents rejected the entire proposal, preventing voting on individual articles and sending it back to the commission for changes. The proposal and articles need a super-majority of 103 votes to be approved; Thursday's set of proposals fell short with 98 votes in favor, 46 against and 8 abstaining. Chileans overwhelmingly voted to draft a new constitution in 2020 a year after protests against inequality rocked the Andean country. But political infighting and controversial suggestions have led to a drop in support for the process.  read more  The assembly has until mid-May to approve articles for the draft constitution and until July to have the draft fully completed. Chileans will vote to approve or reject the new constitution on Sept. 4. If voters reject it, Chile will stick with its current market-oriented constitution, which dates back to the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet over three decades ago.","186":"April 21 (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX) cut its annual copper production outlook on Thursday as operations at its Escondida project in Chile were impacted by labour shortages due to rising COVID-19 cases, while road blockades associated with social unrest in the country blocked access to the mine. Chile, the world's top copper producer, earlier this month sued BHP, among other miners, over alleged environmental damages caused by its operations in the Atacama salt flats.  read more  The road blockades, threats of work stoppage over alleged worker contract breaches, and surging COVID-19 infections at Escondida affected production at the project, which houses the world's largest copper deposit.  read more  \"Our Chilean assets experienced a challenging operating environment in the March 2022 quarter due to a reduction in our operational workforce as a result of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Chile,\" the miner said in its third-quarter production report. Copper production from Escondida is now expected between 1,000 thousand tonnes (kt) and 1,030 kt for 2022, down from its previous range of 1,020 kt to 1,080 kt, resulting in a slight downgrade to total copper output forecast to between 1,570 kt and 1,620 kt. The miner has logged 1,112 kt of copper output so far this financial year, down 10% from last year.

Leftist legislators are proposing a 10% withdrawal but Boric and Finance Minister Mario Marcel have said it would worsen spiraling inflation. In March, Chile reported its highest monthly inflation rate - 1.9% - since 1993.  read more  According to the government, Boric's plan represents a fifth of the money by limiting withdrawals to pay alimony, mortgages and other kinds of debt that won't cause inflationary pressure. \"Naturally, this is less damaging than a full pension withdrawal, but it increases disposable income and may have some impact on demand and inflation,\" a Bank of America report released last week said.  read more  The debate is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) and expected to conclude late at night. Legislative rules require that the proposal to allow full withdrawal needs 93 of 155 votes to pass while Boric's proposal requires 78. Chile's government has used early pension withdrawals to help citizen's deal with the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, approving three withdrawals of 10% since June 2020 and rejecting a fourth in December. Boric's government opposed a new withdrawal, but submitted a last-minute limited proposal when a congressional committee was set to vote on another withdrawal. \"To move this forward we need to take care of the economy, because we need these reforms to settle in a scenario that allows them to be sustainable,\" government spokeswoman Camila Vallejo told reporters. Boric supported the previous four withdrawals, but the government says that another 10% withdrawal would leave nearly half of workers, around 5.8 million people, without savings. Boric has proposed reforming the pension system and has announced a $3.7 billion economic recovery plan.  read more ","188":"SANTIAGO, April 14 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric faces an economic slowdown and high inflation, which conflicts with his goal to expand social programs, and could increase pressure for more financial stimulus, according to a Bank of America report released on Thursday. The government recently announced a $3.7 billion economic recovery plan to support sectors still affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and while the report states the plan is \"reasonable and targeted so far ... there will be pressure to spend more.\"  read more  The report says that higher food prices and a weakening economy clash with the population's high expectations of reform from the new government and the drafting of a new constitution, putting pressure on more spending. On Tuesday, the government presented a limited pension withdrawal plan in an attempt to block a larger withdrawal promoted by legislators.  read more  The bank said that while the government's limited proposal would have less impact on inflation as it represents a fifth of the money from the larger withdrawal, it still presents risks for the economy and prices. \"This is naturally less damaging than a full pension withdrawal, but it increases disposable income and may have some impact on demand and inflation,\" the bank said. The report also said that Chile's central bank has taken a \"dovish rhetoric\" on raising interest rates given fears of a recession, but this will be \"tested by recent inflation surprises.\" In March, Chile reported a monthly inflation rate of 1.9%, the highest level since 1993.  read more  A separate report from Capital Economics predicts Chile's central bank will deliver at least 200 basis points of additional rate hikes in the current cycle, to 9%. \"That's more tightening than the path implied by the central bank's rate corridor as well as the latest analyst consensus,\" the Capital Economics report stated.","189":"SANTIAGO, April 14 (Reuters) - In a marathon voting session to restructure Chile's political system that finished late Wednesday night, the country's constitutional assembly voted to replace its 200-year-old senate with a new \"chamber of regions\". The assembly has been working on a new draft constitution that will go to a referendum on Sept. 4, and eliminating or reforming the senate has been a key goal of left-wing members, who say it stalls or halts progress and laws. Opponents said the proposal would give too much power to the lower house and centralize decision-making. \"Regions wouldn't have a voice when it comes to health, pensions, transport or education,\" Hernan Larrain, a conservative constituent said on the assembly floor. While the article creating the new body reached the two-thirds majority needed to be included in the constitution, the article defining its powers failed and will now go back to the commission for further debate and another vote. Ricardo Montero, a constituent and coordinator of the commission, told reporters that the commission will rework the agreement to garner more support. \"Without a doubt we're worried about some of the articles that failed,\" he said. Eliminating the senate had divided the commission earlier in negotiations and led to a medley of conflicting proposals largely voted down by the full assembly last month. The new agreement came after polls showed support for the new constitution faltering, with some voters saying infighting and extreme proposals were causing them to lose faith in the process. read more  The assembly has until May 17 to approve articles before handing over the draft constitution to a commission in charge of fine-tuning the document. \"This is a very complex topic, very technical,\" Rosa Catrileo, a constituent and commission coordinator told reporters after the vote. \"It's a challenge, we have little time, but we still have time.\" Next week the constitutional assembly is set to vote on articles that could redefine water rights and reshape mining rights in the world's no. 1 copper producer.","190":"SANTIAGO, April 12 (Reuters) - A new pension withdrawal in Chile was voted down by a congressional committee Tuesday night after President Gabriel Boric submitted a competing proposal hours earlier that cleared a vote in a separate committee. Chile has resorted to allowing early pension withdrawals to help citizens deal with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Three withdrawals of up to 10% of a worker's pension funds have been approved since July 2020. A fourth was voted down in December. Boric's government had opposed a new withdrawal of 10%, saying it would pump too much money into an economy already struggling with spiraling inflation.  read more  Then, hours before the scheduled vote, Boric's government introduced a separate bill that would allow withdrawals only to pay off debts. This measure, the government says, would mitigate inflationary effects. \"It is a way of making pension funds saved by workers available for matters in which their use does not imply higher inflation, higher demand or higher consumption,\" Finance Minister Mario Marcel told reporters. The government's new proposal would also cap withdrawals at 10%, but restricts access to pension funds for alimony payments, mortgages and other debts. The bill also bolsters unemployment insurance. Both bills were debated simultaneously, with Boric's proposal clearing the committee first. Some legislators in favor of a blanket 10% withdrawal argued that the government shouldn't have a say in how people use their pension funds. Despite the committee votes, both bills will face a full vote in the lower house, where the unrestricted withdrawal is also expected to be voted down. Although Boric had supported the four previous withdrawals, speaking to reporters, he said a new withdrawal without limits would \"deeply hurt the neediest\" by spurring inflation and lowering the value of their funds. \"We think (this bill) is an alternative that both helps families get ahead in tough times and is also responsible,\" Boric said.","191":"SANTIAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - As a punishing, record-breaking drought enters its 13th year, Chile on Monday announced an unprecedented plan to ration water for the capital of Santiago, a city of nearly 6 million. \"A city can't live without water,\" Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, said in a press conference. \"And we're in an unprecedented situation in Santiago's 491-year history where we have to prepare for there to not be enough water for everyone who lives here.\" The plan features a four-tier alert system that goes from green to red and starts with public service announcements, moves onto restricting water pressure and ends with rotating water cuts of up to 24 hours for about 1.7 million customers. The alert system is based off the capacity of the Maipo and Mapocho rivers that supply the capital with most of its water and have seen dwindling water levels as the drought drags on. The government estimates that the country's water availability has dropped 10% to 37% over the last 30 years and could drop another 50% in northern and central Chile by 2060. The water deficit in the rivers, measured in liters per second, will determine if cuts will take place every 12, six or four days. In each case, a different area would face water cuts each day. \"This is the first time in history that Santiago has a water rationing plan due to the severity of climate change,\" Orrego said. \"It's important for citizens to understand that climate change is here to stay. It's not just global, it's local.\" Certain areas in the city center would be exempt due to the high concentration of capitals. Areas fed by well water or other sources besides the two rivers will also be exempt.","192":"MEXICO CITY, April 8 (Reuters) - Central banks from Brazil to Chile may be forced to dole out more monetary \"medicine\" than expected as inflation in the region continue to surge, defying sharp interest rate hikes and spurring discontent over rising food and fuel prices. Brazil's monthly inflation has surged beyond forecasts to the highest in 28 years.  read more  Chile went one better with the biggest jump since 1993, Mexico has posted a 21-year-high annual figure and Peru the highest in a quarter of a century.  read more  That, analysts say, will push central banks towards hiking rates faster than planned, a reflection of how tough it has become to bring down inflation, with soaring commodities costs and the war in Ukraine heating up prices globally. \"The inflation reality is asking for more monetary medication,\" said Alfredo Coutino, director Latin America at Moody's Analytics. Policymakers had signaled slower rises ahead after steep hikes earlier in the year. Chile has raised its benchmark rate 650 basis points since the middle of last year. Brazil has hiked the rate to 11.75% from a record-low 2% last March. That's failed so far to rein in prices, with annual inflation also surging, pushed up by grocery prices and fuel costs, a volatile mix which is stirring angry protests in Peru and forcing political leaders to take evasive action. TIGHTENING CYCLE William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that higher-than-expected inflation rates backed the view that regional central banks will need to raise interest rates by more than expected. \"It reinforces our view that the tightening cycle will go further than the path implied by the central bank's latest guidance and the analyst consensus,\" he wrote in a note. After the latest inflation data, Brazilian interest rate futures rose across the board and economists flagged that next month's widely expected interest rate increase may not be the last of the cycle, as the bank had previously suggested. In Argentina, where annual inflation is running above 50% and is expected to keep rising, the central bank is now likely to lift the interest rate again in April, a source at the entity told Reuters, after three straight hikes this year. \"There should be a new upward adjustment this month,\" the person with direct knowledge of discussions said, adding though that the hike would likely be capped at 150 basis points to avoid stymieing economic growth. 'INFLATION IS BACK' The headache for policymakers in Latin America, a major global producer of commodities from copper to corn, comes as global supply crunches heat up prices worldwide. Almost 60% of developed economies now have year-on-year inflation above 5%, the largest share since the late 1980s, while it is over 7% in more than half of the developing world. That's rattling governments from Sri Lanka to Peru, which has been gripped by angry protests in recent weeks against soaring fuel and food prices. The central bank has responded by hiking the interest rate to the highest since 2009.  read more  And in region's second largest economy, Mexican consumer prices rose in March at a pace not seen since 2001, with economists now expecting more interest rate hikes ahead.  read more  Still, the fight to bring down prices may be a long one. The head of the Bank for International Settlements Agustin Carstens warned earlier this week the world is facing a new era of higher inflation and interest rates as deteriorating ties between the West, Russia and China and COVID after-effects drive globalisation into reverse.  read more  \"Inflation is back,\" said the BIS central bank umbrella group.","193":"SANTIAGO, April 8 (Reuters) - Chile's consumer prices rocketed 1.9% in March, the highest monthly rise in almost thirty years, underscoring the challenge for authorities as they battle spiraling inflation exacerbated by rising global commodities costs. The Andean country's official statistics agency said on Friday that the rise had been driven by food prices, non-alcoholic beverages and education. The monthly figure was far higher than the 1.05% rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists and is the highest monthly inflation rate since 1993. The rolling 12-month rate rose further to around 9.4%, the highest since 2008. That remains far above the central bank's target rate of 2% to 4%, which has been driving a recent spate of interest rate hikes and may prompt more tightening ahead.

The plan also includes subsidies for parents of young children, a one-time payment for culture workers and $300 million fund for local governments to use for infrastructure. Boric said the plan was aimed at helping those \"who haven't found private or state help to get ahead,\" and will offer financing for small-scale miners and 100,000 small businesses without access to banks. Chile's central bank last month lowered its economic growth forecast for 2022 and predicted annual inflation could reach 8.2%. read more  \"We know this recovery plan is a starting point,\" Boric said. \"Big changes aren't made overnight and for these changes to be sustainable, they have to be implemented responsibly.\"","195":"SANTIAGO, April 6 (Reuters) - Javier Alonso, a Chilean telecoms worker, voted in 2020 in favor of a landmark plan to replace the country's constitution that dates from the era of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Now his support is wavering. Opinion polls this week showed for the first time that more Chileans would reject the new text than approve it, as it looks increasingly possible that it will fail in a national yes-no vote planned for September.  read more  That would be a blow for its architects and supporters – including progressive new President Gabriel Boric – who hope it will underpin major economic and social reforms. Many critics have argued that the current 1980 text is illegitimate due to its dictatorship origins that they say give right-wing parties an unfair boost and underpin deep economic inequality. A referendum two years ago to replace the constitution won huge support after months of violent protests in 2019 against inequality, and an assembly was chosen to draft the new text. But political squabbling within the assembly and a raft of proposals on areas from pensions to reforming Congress that are more radical than many Chileans had bet on has thrown the future of the new constitution into doubt. \"I haven't decided if I'm going to vote to reject or approve it,\" said Alonso - a sharp shift from 2020, when he volunteered as an election observer for the approve camp in the referendum. He criticized the assembly representatives for making \"wild proposals for five minutes of fame on Twitter,\" which he said was harming people's faith in the process. \"I'm starting to lose trust that something good is going to come out of this,\" he said. If the new text is rejected then the Pinochet-era version would remain in place, a major setback for the 36-year-old Boric, who took office last month pledging a social and economic overhaul. \"This government is very associated with the idea of building a new cycle that starts with a constitution that replaces Pinochet's one,\" said Cristobal Bellolio, a professor of political theory. \"If the (no vote) wins, it would be a political earthquake.\" CALLS FOR CHANGE The 154-member assembly is divided into commissions, each one in charge of drafting a different part of the new constitution on areas such as environment, justice and the political system. Proposals require a simple majority to pass from commissions to face a vote in the full assembly, where a two-thirds majority is needed to be included in the draft constitution. Rejected proposals can be amended before facing a second vote. The assembly is dominated by independents and leftists whose proposals have included the right to reproductive rights, including abortion, self-governance for indigenous territories, and making combating climate change a state duty. While those strike a chord with a rising progressive movement they have sparked opposition from conservatives and moderates. \"People called for changes to pensions, public transport costs, the right to healthcare, but what we are seeing is a convention that's distanced itself from people's expectations,\" said Francisco Zambrano, a constitutional lawyer in Santiago. Pamela Figueroa, a political analyst at the University of Santiago, said the assembly had also struggled to communicate effectively with voters, while opponents to the redraft have campaigned aggressively on social media. Some proposals have already failed dramatically. The commission in charge of designing the political framework saw 93 of its 96 proposals voted down by the assembly in March, including a proposal for a unicameral congress. \"The disagreements are linked to different solutions or ways we can see to get out of an institutional crisis,\" said Barbara Sepulveda, a lawyer from Chile's communist party who is involved in the redraft. Sepulveda supported abolishing the Senate, saying it held up change, but conservative representatives pushed back, arguing the upper house was an important check on government power. The commission has now proposed keeping the Senate in a weakened form. The environmental commission - dominated by self-proclaimed \"eco-constituents\" - waved through its proposals, but only one out of 40 was approved by the assembly in the first vote. The commission will vote on more measures this week, including ones related to nationalizing water and mining, a major topic of debate in the world's no. 1 copper producer. Juan Jose Martin, 25, who coordinates the environmental commission, said it had learned from its mistakes and was now reaching across the political aisle. \"What we're doing now is a consensus model,\" Martin said. \"Whatever has 100% percent support, or 99%... that's what goes in.\"","196":"AUGUSTA, Ga., April 5 (Reuters) - Tiger Woods will mark his return to competition at this week's Masters at 10:34 a.m. ET (1434 GMT) on Thursday in a group with South African Louis Oosthuizen and Chilean Joaquin Niemann, according to the starting times released on Tuesday.

Among the other notable groups is the penultimate threesome of 2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth, world number four Viktor Hovland and Xander Schauffele, who challenged Matsuyama in the final round last year before ending up tied for third.","197":"BUENOS AIRES, April 4 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric, visiting Argentine President Alberto Fernandez on his first trip abroad since taking power last month, vowed to work with his cross-Andean neighbors on economic, energy and cultural issues. \"We have challenges that are deeply shared,\" Boric said at a joint news conference with the Argentine president in Buenos Aires. Argentina's economy minister, Martin Guzman, and Chile's energy minister, Claudio Huepe Minoletti, signed a joint declaration addressing issues of integration and bilateral energy cooperation. \"Guzman and Huepe discussed the commercialization of natural gas, the Argentine export of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and oil, and the rehabilitation of the Neuquen-Biobio pipeline,\" a statement from the Argentine treasury said. In the mid-2000s, after its own supply faltered, the Argentine government cut off crucial gas exports to Chile, triggering a diplomatic crisis. In 2018, the gas exports resumed. By January 2022, Argentine exports to Chile totaled $351 million - including LNG - while imports from Chile totaled $53 million, according to official data. Boric and Fernandez, both leftists, also discussed politically sensitive issues, including conflict with the Mapuche indigenous community who reside largely in Chile but also in Argentina, and Sergio Apablaza, a former guerrilla in Argentine custody who Chilean authorities want extradited. Chile is Argentina's fifth-largest trading partner and one of its main investors.","198":"SANTIAGO, April 4 (Reuters) - Chilean voters are cooling on a planned new constitution to replace the current Augusto Pinochet-era text, opinion polls on Monday showed, with those opposing the redraft surpassing those who plan to approve it for the first time. A survey by pollster Cadem shows 46% of respondents would vote against the new text, which is still being drafted by an elected assembly and will face a nationwide referendum this year. That was 13 percentage points higher than in late January. Support meanwhile has dropped from 56% to just 40% now, with a sharp recent decline due to voters losing confidence in the process and controversial planned changes to property rights, the structure of Congress and pension funds. Chileans voted in 2020 to replace the Andean country's constitution that dates back to the military dictatorship of Pinochet. The market-oriented text is seen as having underpinned decades of growth but stoking huge inequality. A second poll from Activa showed a similar trend with 35.8% of respondents planning to reject the new constitution, 32% supporting it and 32.2% unsure. That was a reverse from 37.7% in support and 31.2% against it earlier in March. Anger over inequality led to months-long violent protests in 2019, a turning point for the Latin American country that has long been heralded as a bastion of conservatism and free-market economics in the region. The elected constitutional assembly has until July to present the new constitution that will then face a mandatory plebiscite towards the end of the year, with a yes or no option of whether to accept it or stick with the existing text. The referendum poses a challenge for new progressive President Gabriel Boric, 36, who came into office in March pledging sweeping social and economic reforms.","199":"SANTIAGO, March 30 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank revised its forecast for 2022 economic growth on Wednesday, dropping it to a range of 1.0% to 2.0% from an estimate of 1.5% to 2.5% in December. \"The economy will expand at rates below its potential in 2022 and 2023, with contractions in private consumption and investment,\" the central bank said in a statement. It also predicated that annual inflation would reach 8.2% this year, above the central bank's tolerance range and up from a previous estimate of 4.5%. The central bank said the rise in consumer prices was a response to the \"excessive increase in spending\" in recent quarters, which was supported by COVID-19 stimulus programs. On Tuesday, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 7%, as it rapidly withdraws the monetary stimulus that followed the start of the pandemic in March 2020. \"The rise in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) has been fast and significant, but the risks of convergence and inflation persist,\" the central bank said. It predicted, however, that \"inflation will begin to converge to the target in the two-year horizon\" in the latter part of 2022. The report also estimated that private consumption and gross fixed capital formation will contract in the 2022-2023 period. The price of copper was also adjusted to $4.35 per pound, up from the previous forecast of $4.05. Chile is the world's largest copper producer.","200":"SANTIAGO, March 29 (Reuters) - Chile’s 2-0 home defeat to Uruguay on Tuesday confirmed their absence from a second consecutive World Cup finals and likely marks the end of the road for the 'Golden Generation' who helped them to back-to-back Copa America titles. Elite players such as Alexis Sanchez, Arturo Vidal and Claudio Bravo helped crown Chile South American champions in 2015 and 2016, but the team's failure to reach Qatar was “a big failure”, captain Gary Medel said. Chile finished seventh of 10 teams in the South American qualifying group, winning only five of 18 games. They lost at Venezuela for the first time, and were held at home by Bolivia, who last reached the World Cup finals in 1994. Medel said he will not retire yet but he and many of the more experienced players are the wrong side of 30 and few of them are likely to get another chance at World Cup glory. Sanchez is 33, defender Charles Aranguiz is 32, while Vidal and Medel are both 34. Goalkeeper Bravo is 38. “It’s inevitable to think of this as the last dance of the Golden Generation, the end of a cycle,” Chile newspaper La Tercera wrote after the Uruguay game. A few youngsters have come through, most notably Ben Brereton, the Blackburn Rover striker who scored four goals in his first 11 internationals, but there are doubts over the calibre of players who are set to replace the veterans.","201":"March 29 (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd (BHP.AX) said on Tuesday it will invest more than $10 billion in Chile to fuel growth in the world's largest copper producing nation for the next 50 years, but only under certain regulatory and fiscal situations. Chile, which supplies nearly a quarter of the world's copper, recently elected a new leftist government, is redrafting its constitution and considering raising its mining royalty to fund expanded social programs. Several copper miners have paused investment decisions in the country while the political negotiations play out. \"We love Chile. We would like to stay here. We would like to grow in this country. But in order to do that, it will require fiscal stability, legal certainty and a clear pathway to permit,\" Ragnar Udd, BHP's president of minerals, Americas, told the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago. BHP already operates Chile's Escondida, the world's largest copper mine. Udd spoke at the conference not long after Marcela Hernando Pérez, the new Chilean mining minister, who said that Santiago does not plan to nationalize the country's mining sector. Perez had left by the time Udd spoke. Udd said that the investments from BHP would fund a new concentrator and leach processing facilities, new mining areas and projects to help reduce the company's carbon emissions. \"I hope that I've convinced you today that under the right investment conditions, we can deliver copper to support the world of the future in a way that is sustainable and create social value for the communities and societies in which we operate,\" Udd said.","202":"SANTIAGO, March 29 (Reuters) - The copper market has solid fundamentals despite current market volatility and will maintain high prices for at least the next 12 months, Ivan Arriagada, CEO of Chile's Antofagasta, forecast. In an interview with Reuters during the CRU-CESCO World Copper Conference in Santiago, Arriagada also said the company is still looking to develop its Twin Metals project despite the Biden administration's refusal to renew its licenses. And although the company is on the lookout, it sees few options for copper deals on the market. When it comes to copper prices, Arriagada said he based his forecast on the key role that copper plays in energy transition, especially with electric cars. \"In the short term, in the next 12 months, the important thing is that we have a market with solid fundamentals,\" Arriagada said. \"There is a context of relative tightness due to supply chain conditions, inflation, and all that means we expect prices to remain at levels that they have been at recently, which are good prices.\" However, he said the world economy is entering a phase of lower growth in the midst of the Ukraine conflict and that will have to be considered going forward, particularly in 2023. The company maintains its goal of producing 660,000-690,000 tonnes this year. This factors in the impact of a drought at its flagship Los Pelambres mine, which the company plans to offset with a desalination plant in the second half of the year. Arriagada reiterated Antofagasta's intention to reach a production level of 900,000 tonnes by 2026, citing the company's deposits. \"We have the mining resources to sustain that projection and a plan that contemplates making those investments, if the conditions exist and we obtain the permits,\" he said. The Antofagasta (ANTO.L) board of directors must decide whether to go ahead with a plan for a new concentrator at its Centinela mine by the end of the year during a time of political uncertainty due to a new leftist government and the drafting of a new constitution. We hope to have \"a horizon of certainty regarding the prevailing conditions to make that investment and we therefore hope that by that time the processes that are under way will be at a degree of progress\" to decide, Arriagada added. Additionally, a plan for a mining royalty to raise revenue for social programs is currently under way in Chile's Congress. \"In tax decisions, a balance between contribution through taxes and industry competitiveness should be maintained and we think that's something extremely important that should be weighed,\" he said. Antofagasta suffered a setback in its Twin Metals project in the United States after the renewal of two federal licenses was suspended. Arriagada said the suspensions affected a significant part of the company's mining operations, but do not affect the rest of the company's licenses. \"We are evaluating the best action, from the legal standpoint, to reverse these decisions, which seem to us to be administrative and clearly arbitrary,\" Arriagada said. \"I hope that over the course of the next six months we'll have clarity on the best legal path to take in regard to recovering these licenses,\" he added. The company expects to be able to implement the project by the end of the decade. On the other hand, Arriagada said the company remains open to any attractive acquisition opportunities to increase its portfolio, but he admitted they are \"very limited.\" Arriagada noted that neighboring Peru remains a point of interest despite ongoing political turmoil and other local challenges. \"We have a team working there looking for exploration targets that could be interesting and we have a preference for that region (Americas), including Peru, and we look at our projects with a long-term perspective,\" Arriagada said.","203":"SANTIAGO, March 25 (Reuters) - Thousands of students marched through the Chilean capital on Friday demanding higher food stipends, the first organized demonstration under former protest leader President Gabriel Boric. Police shot one student who was stable after being treated in a hospital, Manuel Monsalves, subsecretary of the interior, told a news conference. Monsalves said there would be an investigation into the shooting. Around 640,000 students who receive 32,000 Chilean pesos ($41) a month to subsidize food want that raised. Although the protest was mostly peaceful, police fired water cannons, and hooded agitators clad in black set street fires and vandalized bus stops. They also attacked a Chilean Air Force pick-up truck stuck in traffic with rocks and metal pipes. The government confirmed that three air force officials were injured and treated in a hospital. The demonstration was smaller than the violent protests that gripped the capital in 2019 and led to the drafting of a new constitution. With a former student protest leader at the helm of the government, protesters said there was more restraint from both police and students despite sparks of violence. \"Deep down the citizenry acted differently, most of all towards police,\" said Andres Calfuqueo, a 21-year-old political science student at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile who also protested in 2019. Calfuqueo said police kept their distance and only responded to attacks.","204":"SANTIAGO, March 22 (Reuters) - The Chilean government will send a long-awaited bill to reform the country's controversial private pension system to congress next year, Finance Minister Mario Marcel said on Tuesday. Reforming the current system, Pension Fund Administrators (AFP), was one of the biggest demands demonstrators had during the 2019 protests. One of the biggest complaints against the system is its low-paying pensions. Leftist President Gabriel Boric proposed eliminating the private system in favor of a public one in his government plan, but Marcel refrained from specifics during a presentation before deputies. The finance minister pointed out that one of the problems of the current system is the low level of contributions from workers and companies compared to other countries. When it came to the reform, he said that the government was going to start a \"social dialogue\" to find governing principles for a new system. \"From there we are going to work on a reform project that can reach Congress during the next year,\" Marcel said. \"We don't want this consultation process to go beyond a couple of months, because we are aware that there is a lot of anxiety to finally see a proposal on the table.\" Congress has also approved three partial withdrawals of pension savings to help households during the pandemic, and a new withdrawal is currently under discussion. Boric's government, which took power on March 11, has a complicated agenda filled with promises of social reforms while struggling with a sputtering economy after it registered historic growth last year.","205":"SANTIAGO, March 21 (Reuters) - An assembly in Chile charged with drawing up the country's new constitution extended the deadline by which the first draft must be ready by three months on Tuesday, as its members struggle to digest a lengthy list of proposals addressing environmental and social issues. With 114 votes in favor, eight against and 25 abstaining, the assembly approved a one-time extension that sets the new date for the draft constitution to July 5. \"Despite our progress, we know we have a long constituent process that has to be done in a short time,\" said Maria Elisa Quinteros, president of the constituent assembly, during a speech before the vote to extend the deadline. \"We can't waste this unique opportunity the citizens of Chile have given us,\" Quinteros said. If the constituent assembly is unable to draft a new constitution by the July 5 deadline, the current one that dates back to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet will remain in effect. Constituents have been debating and voting on proposals since mid February and Quinteros said that 84 articles have been approved so far. There were originally more than 1,200 proposals, but some were rejected in committees, others were removed, and several merged together. The environmental commission, for example, had 40 proposals but only one has been approved. Francisco Zambrano, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chile, told Reuters that time limits were essential because drafting a new constitution creates \"uncertainty and institutional instability.\" With proposals that include reshaping Chile's political system and nationalizing mining, the assembly has sent jitters through markets during the past year. Any proposal needs the agreement of two-thirds of the assembly to make it to the final draft, which has tempered some of the more radical ones. An article guaranteeing women's reproductive rights, including abortion, was approved last week, putting at least one controversial topic on the ballot in a historically conservative country.  read more  Chileans will decide whether to approve or reject the proposed constitution in a mandatory plebiscite later this year.","206":"SANTIAGO, March 17 (Reuters) - A union representing workers at BHP's (BHP.AX) sprawling Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world's largest copper mine, on Thursday threatened a work stoppage over what it claims are breaches in its collective contract. Escondida's Union 1 requested an urgent meeting with company executives to discuss its complaints over promotions, saying many conditions in the contract were not being upheld by the firm, according to a letter seen by Reuters. It asked the issues be resolved shortly or it will initiate \"labor actions,\" implying a stoppage. This \"may mean, among other measures, the exercise of strikes or collective abstentions from work, for as long as is agreed,\" the union said in the letter. If the union calls for a stoppage, it will let the company know beforehand so measures can be adopted to \"safeguard\" company assets. BHP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The union and the company signed the new collective contract last August. In January, the union accused the firm of being erratic and irresponsible as COVID-19 infections had risen among the workforce. Last year, workers at the mine won a historic benefits package at the bargaining table, which included bonuses distributed to all workers in equal parts, the union said at the time.  read more ","207":"SANTIAGO, March 16 (Reuters) - Chile's divisive battle over abortion rights could get a central role in the Andean country's planned new constitution after an assembly voted to approve part of the draft text that calls on the state to guarantee women's reproductive rights. A week after thousands of women marched through the streets of Santiago on International Women's Day, Chile's constituent assembly voted to include reproductive rights, including \"a voluntary interruption of pregnancy\" in the draft constitution. Fighting through tears before the vote on Tuesday, constituent Loreto Vidal took the floor to talk about how her mother died due to a septic abortion. \"They try to divide us as those who are in favor of life, and those apparently in favor of death,\" Vidal said. \"Every person has the right to liberty, understood as the free determination of their personality, their life projects, their identity and the autonomy over their body.\" While historically conservative with a strong influence from the Catholic Church, Latin America has seen abortion rights expand in recent years with Mexico, Argentina and Colombia. Chile's Congress, however, rejected a bill in November that sought to expand legal access to abortions. Termination is legal for women under conditions where their life was in danger, a fetus unviable or when a pregnancy resulted from rape. Chile would become the first Latin American country to have the right to abortion enshrined in its constitution if the new text is approved in a referendum later this year. It would replace one dating to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship decades ago. The move would not automatically expand legal abortion rights, said Carla Navea, a mother of three girls from the northern city of Antofagasta, but would mark a step forward for future generations of Chilean women. \"As a woman and as a mother of three girls, this means we'll stop being second-class citizens,\" Navea said. \"The power to decide for ourselves is the most important.\" While Chile's constituent assembly is predominantly made up of left-leaning members and independents, Congress is split and could be a limiting factor to the new Constitution and new leftist president Gabriel Boric's progressive goals. \"(Congress) is pretty even when it comes to protection or no protection, access or no access,\" said Danitza Perez, director of an association of feminist lawyers in Chile. \"What the Constitution does in this case is make a framework of sexual and reproductive rights that have to be developed at a legal level.\"","208":"SANTIAGO, March 14 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric, who took office last week, said on Monday his government would balance plans to expand the Andean country's social programs, while being fiscally responsible, a message likely aimed at the domestic business community and global investors. \"We have to be very careful with public spending,\" Boric said, noting that his government would be respectful of the country's fiscal balance. \"Permanent spending has to be financed with permanent revenue,\" Boric added. With a fragile economy, high inflation, pandemic aftershocks and global uncertainty over the Ukraine war, Boric said he plans achieve his economic goals through a tax reform bill he hopes will increase tax collection by 5 basis points of the gross domestic product (GDP) over four years. Boric added that economist Mario Marcel, his pick for finance minister, was a \"progressive\" and that the two were on the same page on economic policy.  read more  Boric, a 36-year-old former student protest leader, has tempered anti-market rhetoric from the election campaign last year. He said he was inviting all sectors of Chilean society - including workers, business and other sectors - to take part tax reform discussions. \"We're not going to say that this reform is against the most wealthy,\" Boric said. \"Tax reform has to have a high technical quality but also, hopefully, the greatest consensus.\" Throughout his first press conference with international media at La Moneda government palace, Boric emphasized his desire for regional cooperation. He said his first international trip would be to neighbor Argentina. \"It won't just be symbolic, but something that will translate into concrete collaborations like easing border crossings, investments,\" Boric said. The country's youngest president said he hoped to revise treaties to improve sharing technology and promote renewable energy. He said the region should tackle issues from immigration to climate change and the Ukraine war with a united front. \"The south has to make itself heard around the world.\" Speaking on international trade, Boric said Chile had strong economic ties with Asia and his government would wait until a new Constitution provides a roadmap to start debating the country's role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact. The Andean country's constituent assembly began formally discussing in February motions for a new Constitution to replace a market-focused one dating back to the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. It will be voted on later this year.  read more  Boric emphasized plans for renewable energy and protecting water sources, adding Chile would this month join the Escazu Agreement, a treaty strengthening environmental and human rights in Latin America, which the country had held off signing under his predecessors.","209":"VALPARAISO, Chile, March 11 (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric was sworn in as president on Friday, vowing to listen to all sides while warning of the challenges ahead, as the Andean country marked the sharpest shift in its politics since the return to democracy three decades ago after the bloody dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. At the Congress building in the port city of Valparaiso, Boric, a 36-year-old, tattooed former protest leader and lawmaker, took the presidential sash from outgoing billionaire President Sebastian Pinera, making him the country's youngest-ever elected leader. \"The road ahead will be long and hard,\" Boric said during his first speech as president from a balcony at La Moneda government palace, overlooking a mostly masked and flag-waving crowd. In a wide-ranging address that touched on economic inclusion, immigration and climate change, Boric energetically pledged to lead a government that represents all citizens, stressing he will reach beyond his leftist base. \"I will always listen to the proposals of those who think differently from us,\" he said. \"I'll be a president for all Chileans.\" Boric's rise has sparked hope among progressives in Chile, long a conservative bastion of free markets and fiscal prudence in volatile South America, but has also stoked fear that decades of economic stability could come undone. The leader of a broad leftist coalition including Chile's communist party, Boric has vowed to overhaul a market-led economic model to fight inequality that sparked violent protests in 2019, though he has moderated his fiery rhetoric in recent months. The copper-producing country is also in the midst of redrafting its Pinochet-era Constitution, which has underpinned growth but been blamed for stoking inequality. \"We need a constitution that unites us,\" thundered Boric. \"A constitution that's different from the one imposed by blood, fire and fraud of the dictatorship.\" Pinochet, whose shadow still looms large over the country, ousted socialist President Salvador Allende, who committed suicide in 1973 during a military coup. Boric has often praised Allende's legacy and did so again in his inaugural address. \"He reminds me of Allende, but I hope it has a happier ending,\" said Marigen Vargas, 62, who traveled all night to be at Boric's inauguration. \"We want a more united, happier Chile.\" 'TASKS LIE AHEAD' Boric faces a raft of challenges from an economic slowdown, high inflation and a split legislature that will test his deal-making abilities to push through reforms in healthcare and pensions, while toughening environmental regulation. Carlos Ruiz, an academic at the University of Chile who taught Boric, said Boric would have to deal with a rising ultra-conservative bloc that did well in elections last year and find consensus to push through his reforms. \"These are now the tasks lying ahead of Boric,\" he said. Boric's female-majority Cabinet was also sworn in on Friday, as delegations from the United States, Spain, Argentina, Peru and others looked on. Among a sea of suits and military garb, a part of the Senate was filled with representatives of Chile's various indigenous communities in traditional attire. \"It's a sign that it's going to be an inclusive government,\" Cecilia Flores, an indigenous Aymara told Reuters in the chamber, adding it was the first time representatives from each indigenous group have been present at the inauguration. \"It's going to be a government that will make the social changes the people of Chile have been fighting for, especially indigenous groups.\" High hopes may quickly butt up against a divided electorate and legislature, split down the middle between the right and left. Lawmakers will face sharply competing visions on fighting crimeanddealing with waves of migrants, as well as indigenous rights. \"I wish him success in his future government,\" the outgoing president, Pinera, said in his final address, while citing concerns about identity politics, weakening of the judiciary, and crime. \"But also the wisdom to distinguish right from wrong.\"","210":"SANTIAGO, March 11 (Reuters) - Chile's tax reform, a key plank of new President Gabriel Boric's economic plan, will focus on individuals, natural resources and environmental levies more than corporations, Finance Minister Mario Marcel told Reuters in his first interview in office. Marcel, speaking hours after being sworn on Friday in along with the rest of Boric's first Cabinet, said the plan was to send a tax reform bill to Congress in the first half of the year, adding it was at the heart of the government's agenda. \"The focus is on the taxation of individuals, natural resources and also green taxes,\" he told Reuters. \"The truth is that there isn't much room left to increase the tax burden of firms without hitting the country's competitiveness.\" Investors are closely watching Boric's economic moves after the 36-year-old leftist leader won election last year pledging to \"bury\" Chile's market-orientated economic model, credited for driving decades of growth but also stoking wide inequality. Boric, a former protest leader and lawmaker, has moderated his rhetoric since then, with the choice of respected former central bank chief Marcel to lead the economic portfolio being widely seen as a market-friendly pick. Marcelo said the aim was to agree a longer-term \"tax pact,\" adding modifications could be separated into different packages \"to advance faster in Congress\". The government wants to increase tax collection by five points of GDP over four years. Regarding closely watched plans for new mining royalties in the world's top copper producer and no. 2 lithium producer, Marcel said that he would look to build on bills already being discussed in Congress versus starting from scratch. Marcel held off from offering updated economic growth targets, but said projections from the central bank in December of 1.5%-2.5% growth this year were a reasonable range. \"It seems reasonable for an economy that has to make a certain adjustment to reduce the inflationary pressures that we've seen in recent months,\" he said, adding that this will imply that domestic demand must \"slow down significantly\". The minister said that although the conflict in Ukraine has little direct effect on Chile's economy, the impact it has brought on fuel and grain prices was a factor to keep an eye on. \"Without a doubt, it is a worrying situation, but fortunately the Chilean economy is a little further away from the conflict and also has mechanisms to absorb this type of shock,\" he said.","211":"SANTIAGO, March 11 (Reuters) - New Chilean President Gabriel Boric, a 36-year-old from outside the political mainstream, has pledged to shake up the Andean country's social fabric and its market-led economic model, although there are signs he has moderated since winning election last year. The former student protest leader and lawmaker takes office on Friday with a majority female Cabinet. A mix of progressives and technocrat among his ministers has soothed some market fears about his presidency, but he faces real challenges ahead. Boric will be under pressure to keep Chile's economy, one the most stable in the region, humming even as he pushes ambitious tax reforms to finance his campaign pledges, including salary adjustments, pension overhaul and health system reform. Having once promised to \"bury\" the country's market-orientated model, his tax reforms aim to raise collection by five points of GDP in four years, with increases for companies and mining, fewer tax breaks, 'green' taxes and wealth levies. The former president of the Central Bank, Mario Marcel, the new finance minister, will lead the economic portfolio, something markets and investors have so far cheered. It is a sign Boric will \"balance both progressive and centrist policies, while also focusing on maintaining macroeconomic stability,\" Moody's said in a client note. The government wants to raise the minimum wage to 500,000 pesos ($621), though Boric will have to \"deal with an economy that will show signs of deceleration and high inflation\" Scotiabank Chile chief economist Jorge Selaive told Reuters. Boric has pledged strong environmental regulations in the world's largest copper producer and second largest lithium producer, in addition to hiking taxes and royalties, all plans likely to face strong push-back by the powerful industry. Areas of focus will include water rights, a glacier law that could hit some mines, and climate change targets. The president has also talked up plans to create a state lithium firm to break the monopoly of private companies such as SQM and Albemarle on production of the ultra-light \"white gold\" metal, a key component of electric vehicle batteries. Boric will contend with a fragmented Congress, where his coalition lacks a majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies, and with the Senate split between right-left blocs. The leftist president has sealed alliances with some center-left parties to broaden his support base needed to pass laws, but will faces a juggling act to hold together his broad coalition, which includes the country's Communist Party. Boric's interior minister, 36-year-old Izkia Siches, faces issues with immigration and crime, major voter concerns in the election that bolstered ultra-conservative candidate Jose Antonio Kast, eventually beaten in a run-off vote. Anti-immigration protests have hit northern regions bordering Peru and Bolivia, while violence has broken out in recent years in the south between Mapuche indigenous groups and authorities over land claims. Boric's administration will oversee the country during the key final stages of an elected assembly drafting a new Constitution to replace the contentious market-led text dating back to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The draft text could include controversial proposals on private property, the nationalization of mining firms and doing away with the bicameral Congress. The final text will face a nationwide referendum, likely in September, to approve or reject the new Constitution.","212":"SANTIAGO, March 10 (Reuters) - Chile's Javier Silva and Jaime Nazar became the first two men to tie the knot in the South American country's history on Thursday after a law allowing same-sex marriage went into effect.

It's something we didn't think could happen.\" Silva and Nazar have been together for seven years and have two young children. They have had a civil union for the last three years, but marriage is a significant step forward for their whole family. \"Now our children have the same rights (as other families) and they will be able to have, we hope, a better future, that they will not be discriminated against for having two parents who love each other,\" Silva added. Despite its long conservative tradition, Chile has been making progress in recent years in recognizing LGBTQ rights. \"My congratulations to Jaime and Javier for being the first couple to marry under the new #EqualMarriage law. To continue advancing for a Chile with equal rights and freedoms for all people,\" President-elect Gabriel Boric, who takes office on Friday, said on Twitter. Same-sex marriage legislation was first discussed in 2017 and pushed by former President Michelle Bachelet, but was delayed until last year. Before that, starting in 2015, same-sex couples were able register a Civil Union Agreement (AUC), which allowed some legal benefits. \"I think we're putting ourselves at the level the rest of the world is living in, which is great,\" Nazar said. \"I know our society is very conservative, but I also know we have a promising future as a country.\"","213":"SANTIAGO, March 11 (Reuters) - Gabriel Boric, who at 36 years old takes office on Friday as Chile's youngest president, has been building towards this moment since childhood. Even as a youth, Boric was a strong public speaker and fell naturally into politics, his younger brother recalled. \"When we were young, people always spoke about some of Gabriel's obvious qualities, such as his rhetoric. My grandparents said, 'This boy is going to be president.' As a joke,\" Simon Boric, 33, told Reuters. \"But then when he became interested in politics in high school, and then he went off to college and became law school student president, listening to him give speeches... you could see there was a political path starting to open up.\" That path, which included stints as a prominent student protest leader and a bearded, T-shirt-wearing lawmaker, has led Boric all the way to the presidency of the Andean nation, long seen as the sensible big brother in volatile South America. Boric has assembled a majority-female cabinet, a mix of young progressives and technocrats. He has moderated since his election campaign last year when he pledged to rip up Chile's vaunted market-orientated model. The leftist leader faces a raft of challenges. Even as the world's top copper producer rewrites its constitution, he needs to balance growth with pledges to tighten environmental regulation and erase entrenched inequality dating to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. People who know him well argue his steely determination and listening skills will help him overcome a split Congress and heal rifts from a divisive election, which saw the far-right surge, if ultimately fall short. \"Determination has always been a key characteristic of Boric,\" said Carlos Ruiz, director of the department of sociology and social sciences at the University of Chile, who taught him. He described the young president as always having been interested in Chile's rapid social changes. \"That is an important value for the type of crossroads he has to face, because this historical crossroads is enormous,\" he said. Boric, who sports tattoos and likes rock music and pop star Taylor Swift, is a native of Punta Arenas in Chile's far south. He attended the private British School before studying law at the University of Chile in Santiago, rising to prominence leading 2011 protests to demand better and more affordable education. \"We used to tease him, saying that this guy's going to be president of Chile,\" said Pazz Sanfurgo, one of Boric's classmates at the British School, said he was des. \"It was because of his conviction. Not necessarily political conviction but his conviction to do what he wanted to do.\" Boric became a lower-house lawmaker, representing Chile's vast and sparsely populated southernmost region of Magallanes. After anger over inequality sparked widespread social uprising in 2019, Boric became a key figure in ironing out the political agreement that led to a referendum to draft a new constitution. While initially a long-shot candidate who barely reached the threshold of 35,000 signatures to run for president, Boric rose to lead a broad leftist coalition and ended winning by a landslide in a run-off against ultraconservative Jose Antonio Kast. He has looked to build bridges with his opponents since, tweeting in January that revolutions were only truly successful when they were \"capable of creating order\" and bringing benefits and certainty even to those people who were against them. His brother said Boric was loyal and committed, staying close to family and old friends. The new president is unlikely to succumb to political pressure and willing to listen to alternative points of view, he said. \"He is a fairly temperate person, who acts a lot out of conviction, not out of dogmatism,\" he said. \"If he does not agree, he is willing to debate and dialogue.\"","214":"SANTIAGO, March 10 (Reuters) - In Barrio Yungay, an edgy central Santiago neighborhood, an artist-owned sourdough bakery rubs shoulders with the Chilean city's oldest barbershop and a mini-market with a flickering back light that sells vegetables, dairy products and snacks. Now the district will be home to a president too, in a powerful sign of changing times in the Andean nation, where anger has risen in recent years over stark inequality and an entrenched ruling elite. Gabriel Boric, a 36-year former student protest leader and lawmaker, will be sworn in as Chile's youngest ever president on Friday, having pledged to rip up the country's conservative, market-orientated rule book and push progressive social reform. Unlike his predecessors, Boric has opted to live in downtown Santiago rather than the capital's wealthy eastern zone of sprawling homes far from the dense city center and flanked by the Andes. Chile has no official presidential residence. \"It's good and notable that the president is coming to live in real Chile,\" said Beatrice di Girolamo, who runs the bakery, half a block east from new barricades for presidential security. \"There are all kinds of people here. Homeless people, people who are well off. There are ordinary people, elegant people. There's a lot of immigration.\" Boric, the head of a broad leftist coalition who came from outside the mainstream political parties, rattled the establishment with fiery rhetoric last year about tearing up Chile's market-orientated model, though has moderated his tone since winning a December election, talking up gradual change. However, he has looked to set store as a progressive, with a majority female Cabinet for the first time in Chile's history, strong support for LGBTQ groups and a focus on fighting climate change. Boric's team declined to comment on his choice of new home, but the message is clear: making a break from past political leaders many say had become disconnected from the people. Amid Santiago's high rises, Yungay stands out with colorful one- and two-story buildings and a medley of elaborate murals. Perfectly preserved buildings stand next to others with crumbling facades. The area also hints at some of the challenges facing Boric, who will need to keep Chile's economy humming even as he looks to bolster environmental regulation of mining, bring down inflation, raise taxes for social spending and tackle fears about crime and immigration, key voter concerns. Once an aristocratic neighborhood, the area is now home to a working-class community and a melting pot for immigrants from Peru, Venezuela and Colombia. Carlos Noriega, 45, owner of the Donde Carlitos mini-market on Boric's new street, said in the last three years local crime has picked up. He said his store was robbed at gunpoint in 2020, a year after violent months-long protests broke out against inequality that many blamed on a constitution dating to the Augusto Pinochet-era dictatorship. Noriega and others said the area's new neighbor had already brought benefits: less garbage on the street, more security and graffiti being painted over. Boric has passed by his store, he said, but he's still waiting for him to become a customer. Others said Boric would have to get used to the neighborhood's rough edges. Security teams have blocked off Boric’s busy street with gates and check every car entering, from government vehicles to beaten-up old Volkswagens driven by locals. Eliza Pacheco, who lives in front of the president's new building with her husband and 12-year-old daughter, said she felt safer now, though worried about street protests on her doorstep. \"He has to assume the consequences of anything that happens. That's his responsibility,\" Pacheco said. \"He has to adapt to us, we don’t have to adapt to him.\" Store owner Noriega said outgoing President Sebastian Pinera and others who came before lived on \"another planet.\" \"He doesn't live in reality with the rest of us,\" said Noriega, who has owned his shop for the last 12 years after arriving from Peru soon after Chile's return to democracy in 1990.","215":"BOGOTA\/BUENOS AIRES\/SANTIAGO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Colombia, Argentina and Chile on Thursday called for swift withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, as other Latin American countries rejected the use of force but stopped short of calling for a Russian exit. Russia invaded Ukraine by land, sea and air in the early morning, in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the attack is an effort to 'denazify' Ukraine.  read more  \"We categorically reject war and we join all the voices of the international community who today clamor for the speedy withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory,\" Colombia's centre-right President Ivan Duque said in a video statement. \"This premeditated and unjustified aggression is a threat to world peace,\" he said. Vice-President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez branded the invasion \"absurd colonialist nostalgia\" on Twitter. Argentina's foreign ministry in a statement called on Russia to cease military actions in Ukraine, while Chile said it would support sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council. \"Our country calls for Russia to withdraw its troops and especially for it to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,\" Chile's Foreign Minister Carolina Valdivia said. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Holguin also condemned Russia, saying it had violated international law, and called for an end to fighting. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who recently met with Putin in Moscow, did not mention the Ukraine crisis in a Thursday address to supporters. Bolsonaro came under strong U.S. criticism for saying during his visit that he was \"in solidarity with Russia,\" without elaborating.  read more  But his Vice President Hamilton Mourao said economic sanctions may not be enough and the West may need to use force against Russia. Mourao's comments went well beyond a statement by the foreign ministry calling for a halt to Russian hostilities and saying it would act as a member of the Security Council to find a peaceful solution. Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez has also recently visited Moscow, prompting some analysts to suggest Russia has courted Latin America amid the Ukraine tensions. Some Latin American countries were less pointed in their criticism. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called for dialogue, while Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard later took a tougher stance, condemning the invasion and demanding Russia end its military operations in Ukraine. Peru's foreign ministry expressed concern and appealed for an end to hostilities, and Paraguay's foreign minister urged dialogue and a ceasefire. Russia's strongest allies in the region - Cuba and Venezuela - had yet to directly address the invasion early on Thursday morning. Venezuela's foreign minister Felix Plasencia on Wednesday backed Putin's fight against what he said was North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) desire for war. Cuba on Wednesday criticized the United States for imposing \"the progressive expansion of NATO towards the borders of the Russian Federation\" and called for a diplomatic solution.  read more ","216":"Feb 22 (Reuters) - South American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre Inc (MELI.O) missed analysts' forecasts after posting a fourth quarter net loss on Tuesday, despite a surge in sales. The company reported a quarterly net loss of $46.1 million, missing the mean Refinitiv forecast of $54.04 million net income. The Nasdaq-listed Argentine company's gross merchandise volume, a widely watched figure for the e-commerce industry's performance, rose 21% from a year earlier to $8 billion. The company, present in 18 countries including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, posted a more than 11.1% rise in active users in the quarter, to 82.2 million. The company continued to post a growth in sales volume and active users, although at a slower pace than from a year earlier. \"Growing at this intensity on such a strong basis of comparison was very positive,\" André Chaves, vice president of strategy, development and investor relations at MercadoLibre, told Reuters, adding that the company might have new investments in Mexico, Brazil and Chile this year. The company said it will open four new logistic centers in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo this year. MercadoLibre's net revenue rose 56% in Brazil and 60.5% in Latin America, to $2.1 billion for the quarter.

A near-flawless Niemann enjoyed a two-shot victory last week at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California, where his 19-under 265 total was one short of the oldest tournament scoring record on the PGA Tour, set by Lanny Watkins in 1985. \"Obviously winning at Riviera and how big that tournament is, all the players that were playing ... it made me prove a lot of things and knowing that I can win there I think you can win anywhere,\" Niemann told reporters ahead of this week's Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. \"That's going to be a good boost of more confidence for what is coming and, yeah, I mean, if I keep playing the way I played that week I know I could be on the top.\" With his win at the Genesis Invitational, Niemann rose 12 spots to 20th in the world rankings and arrives at PGA National this week for the start of the Florida swing eager to add more hardware to his trophy case. The par-70 Champion layout -- whose \"Bear Trap\" is known as one of the most demanding three-hole stretches in golf -- is one of tougher ones on tour but relishes playing on courses where the winning score could easily be one digit under par. \"I always like playing challenging courses,\" said Niemann, who loves about a 10-minute drive from PGA National. \"It reflects and it pays a lot to guys that hit it good off the tee and good irons. So I think it could fit good my game, hopefully have a good week and why not go back-to-back?\" Niemann will play the opening two rounds this week alongside four-times major champion Brooks Koepka and Canadian Mackenzie Hughes.","218":"SANTIAGO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Chile's constituent assembly began formally debating on Tuesday motions for a new Constitution to replace a market-focused one dating back to the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, a text that could reshape the world's top copper-producing nation. Embryonic plans to nationalize mining, the creation of a one-chamber Congress, water rights, and protections for indigenous territories are some of the more edgy motions the assembly will discuss and vote on in over 20 plenary sessions. \"In this period we are going to see what is really going to remain in the proposed Constitution,\" said constituent assembly president Maria Elisa Quinteros, noting that the text would face a nationwide referendum planned for September. The new Constitution - which comes as Gabriel Boric, a 36-year-old leftist former student protest leader, is set to take office as president in March - could mark the Andean country's most dramatic political and social shift since its return to democracy in 1990. The new Constitution has sparked jitters among investors and mining firms, raising a challenge to the country's market-oriented economic model, which dates back to the so-called Chicago Boys economists during the time of Pinochet's bloody military rule. On the discussion list are water and property rights, central bank independence, and labor practices. Other themes include animal rights, feminist education, protection of the natural world, and the legalization of cannabis. The proposals will be debated in coming months and will need approval by two-thirds of delegates, some 103 votes. If approved they would face a process of modifications before a second definitive vote to be included in the final text. If rejected they would go back to the commission to be revised or discarded. The potential for sharp shifts in the country has caused some alarm among conservatives, though Quinteros sought to allay fears, saying there had been lots of \"misinformation\" around the process and that the motions were at an early stage. But those fears have seen some loss of support for the process, with a survey from private pollster Cadem showing that the proportion of people who currently intended to vote to approve the new Constitution had fallen to 47% from 56%. The constitutional body, elected last year, is dominated by independent and left-leaning representatives, some with roots in the 2019 protest movement that broke out over inequality in one of the region's wealthiest countries. Kenneth Bunker, director of consultancy Tresquintos, said this was an important moment for \"concerns\" to be raised to avoid \"wacky\" motions moving forward and undermining trust in the process. But Bunker still thought the new constitution would eventually pass, though it would create a challenge for Boric's new government. \"In the short term, the government of Gabriel Boric, if this Constitution comes to pass, will have a real challenge to balance the social infrastructure with the political and economic situation in Chile today,\" he said.","219":"SANTIAGO, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Demonstrators protesting migration and rising crime blocked roads in northern Chile on Friday, the day after a trucker fell from a bridge and died during an argument with immigrants, who were later arrested. Truckers blocked roads around the northern mining cities of Antofagasta and Iquique, as well as other nearby towns. Flights in Iquique were suspended again as they were at the end of January, when truckers blocked roads in that city to protest crime and migration from Venezuela. Union leaders for the protesting truckers held a teleconference with Chile's President Sebastian Pinera and the Interior Minister. \"There is a call to dialogue and to understand that with dialogue ... we are going to have good results in terms of public order and security,\" said Maximo Pavez, a representative of the president's office. \"We call on local actors, unions, local political authorities to understand that violence is not the path to resolving our differences,\" said Pavez. Despite pandemic restrictions, migrants from Venezuela and elsewhere have kept arriving in Chile, one of the wealthiest countries in a region rocked by protests over entrenched inequality. Many impoverished migrants arrive in Chile and set up tents in squares and other public spaces. Some local residents blame the newcomers for a spike in crime. Police are investigating the death of the young truck driver on Thursday. Migration and crime were big voter concerns in presidential elections late last year, which were won by Gabriel Boric, 35, a leftist lawmaker and former student protest leader who comes into office in March.","220":"LIMA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - At least seven people have died after a light aircraft crashed during a flight above the Nazca Lines archaeological site in Peru, local police and the national government said on Friday. Local police said that the deceased included three Dutch tourists, two Chilean tourists, and two Peruvian members of crew. The Ministry of Transport and Communications said in a statement that the Cessna 207 aircraft crashed in the vicinity of the Maria Reiche airport in the city of Nazca. \"As a result of the accident there have been no survivors,\" it said, adding that the cause of the accident is being investigated. The head of the Nazca police, Commander Edgar Espinoza, told journalists that the plane apparently caught fire after hitting the ground. The Nazca Lines, one of Peru's most popular tourist attractions, is a UNESCO world heritage site home to hundreds of gigantic geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years, showing figures that include a hummingbird, monkey, spider, pelican and whale. The protected 400-square-kilometer (250-square-mile) region, which lies some 450 km south of the capital Lima between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, is often viewed by tourists from the sky to get the best view of the huge ancient figures.

The 27-year-old, who represented Chile across almost all Alpine skiing disciplines in the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics, is hoping for a top 20 finish in the men's downhill race on Sunday, the first Alpine race of the Beijing Games. \"I’m confident, this course really suits me. Very technical, not much gliding which is my biggest weakness,\" he said of the course nicknamed \"The Rock\" which is being inaugurated at this year's Olympics. Sacrificing time with his family and girlfriend in Chile, he spends around half the year on the skiing circuit which is heavily focused in central Europe, making it harder for skiers from other continents to get a foothold in the sport. \"Coming from Chile, Argentina or even Norway, it's hard for relations and the family. Of course, if you want to beat all these guys you need to train the same or more to be able to compete. I don’t really want to give any advantage to nobody, so I’m always training,\" he said. \"My dream is just to beat all these guys every time. If I do it, I think a lot of Chileans will be inspired. I hope in the future we can do a World Cup in Chile.\" At the 2018 Winter Games, Von Appen came 30th in the super-G and 34th in the downhill. In four World Championship appearances, he got into the top 30 three times, with his best results in downhill. Still recovering from a bad injury sustained in 2019, he is hungry for bigger things. \"I love racing for Chile. I have Chile in my heart. I just want to do better than my last Olympics and keep moving on,\" he added. \"Hopefully one day I go for the medals and (can) be the first Latin American medal in history in winter sports.\"","222":"SANTIAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Chilean protesters marched against immigration and crime in the Andean country's far north on Sunday, with some violent factions destroying belongings from migrant camps in the streets amid growing tension in the region over border controls. Photos showed protesters, many carrying Chilean flags, breaking up tent structures and bedding in the northern city of Iquique and putting it into a big pile, an echo of angry protests in September last year when camps were burned. Despite pandemic restrictions in recent years, many migrants from Venezuela and elsewhere have kept trying to reach Chile, one of the wealthiest countries in the region, which has been rocked in recent years by protests over entrenched inequality. \"This can't go on,\" read one protest banner from Sunday's march in the coastal city by several thousand people, who were complaining about what they called a spike in illegal immigration and an increase in crime. Local media reported that a group of protesters had attacked one migrant man. Videos on social networks showed the man lying on the ground surrounded by police officers while protesters, waving Chilean flags and holding saucepans, shouted at him. The call to protest came after a group of Venezuelan migrants recently attacked police officers at a checkpoint, for which they were detained. Protesters on social media also called for strike action in the city over the situation. Migration and crime were a big voter concern in presidential elections late last year, which were won by Gabriel Boric, 35, a leftist lawmaker and former student protest leader who comes into office in March.","223":"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Thousands of truck drivers from Argentina were stuck at the Chilean border on Saturday due to slow COVID-19 testing, as Chile faced its second transport delay crisis. Since Jan. 21, more than 3,000 trucks have been stranded at the customs checkpoint of Cristo Redentor in Mendoza, according to the Argentinean Federation of Business Entities for Cargo Transport (FADEEAC). The long wait has put both drivers and some of the trucks to the test, as trucks with refrigerator units must stay running at all times to keep the cargos at cold temperatures. \"This is becoming a real problem,\" said Brazilian truck driver Junior Cesar, whose truck is parked in Uspallata, Argentina, near the Chilean border. \"The engines are running day and night and they’re starting to fail and affect the cargo.\" Frustrated drivers waited by their trucks, cooking and sharing whatever food they could buy. They showered using buckets of water or a bathroom nearby that charges 300 Argentine pesos ($3) per use. \"I’ve been here for two weeks,\" said Ruben Soza, a truck driver from Mendoza. \"I have a refrigeration unit as you can see, with garlic, and the gasoline is not enough to run the refrigeration unit.\" A similar problem has occurred at Chile's northern border in the Tambo Quemado mountain pass, where drivers from Bolivia too face long waits in line for COVID-19 testing. The FADEEAC has asked Argentina’s foreign ministry to intervene and try to prevent further delays and minimize the economic losses, which according to FADEEAC estimates add up to $700 a day. On Friday, Chile’s health ministry reported 26,727 new COVID-19 cases. Argentina reported 63,884.","224":"CALAMA, Chile, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Argentina were without Lionel Messi but goals from Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez gave the visitors all three points against Chile in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday. Argentina, who have already qualified for Qatar, opted to rest Messi after his COVID-19 infection but his Paris Saint Germain team mate Di Maria stepped up to give them the lead with a trademark curling shot from outside the box after 10 minutes. Chile’s English-born striker Ben Brereton equalised just over 10 minutes later when he sent a fine looping header over goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Argentina then took advantage of an injury to Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo to seal the win 11 minutes before half time. Bravo was preparing to be substituted when Rodrigo de Paul fired in a fierce drive from 30 metres, and with the goalkeeper only able to parry the shot Lautaro Martinez followed up to slot home the rebound. \"We knew it was going to be difficult at high altitude and after a long flight,\" said Di Maria. \"The important thing is that we come away with a win. \"Everything is always much easier when Leo is here. The important thing is that we keep working like we’ve been doing and bringing joy to Argentines.\" The result, which was also achieved without the presence of talismanic coach Lionel Scaloni, who was isolating at home due to COVID-19, marks Argentina’s 28th game without defeat. Brereton's goal was the first against Argentina in seven qualifiers. “Today we were without the best in the world and our coach as well but we got the victory and this is also for them,” said Di Maria. The result was a huge blow to Chile's hopes of qualifying for Qatar. They are seventh, on 16 points, in the 10-team South American qualifying group with only three matches to play. The top four qualify automatically and the fifth-placed team goes into a playoff with a side from the Asian confederation. Leaders Brazil and second-placed Argentina have already qualified and Ecuador, who are third with 24 points, are almost certain to join them.","225":"BOGOTA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Singapore has signed a free trade agreement with the Pacific Alliance - made up of Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Chile - those governments said on Wednesday, in a deal they said would facilitate trade and closer ties with Asia.

In attendance at the meeting were Colombian President Ivan Duque, Peruvian President Pedro Castillo, Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and Mexico finance minister Rogelio Ramirez. The Pacific Alliance members will now ratify the agreement in their respective legislatures, the statement added. It will come into force once at least two countries' lawmakers have signed off on it. \"This is a landmark moment in Singapore's partnership with the Pacific Alliance,\" said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a video, adding the agreement will \"institutionalize and strengthen the economic links between our countries.\" The Alliance and Ecuador have said the South American country plans to join as a full member soon.","226":"Jan 24 (Reuters) - Chilean author Isabel Allende heralded the young and female-dominated incoming government of President-elect Gabriel Boric on Monday and said it marked a much-needed changing of the guard of the Andean country's political leadership. \"It's a new generation rising to power. It's time for the old windbags to go home and play bingo,\" the 79-year-old writer said during a Zoom press conference to mark the launch of her latest novel \"Violeta,\" a tale inspired by her mother. The 35-year-old Boric revealed his Cabinet on Friday. It was majority female, with over half a dozen ministers under the age of 40 and including other politicians who made their name, like Boric, during student-led street protests a decade ago. \"I am delighted by the ministers Boric has appointed because it is very diverse, there are 14 women and 10 men. There really is a solid intention there for gender parity and that is just extraordinary,\" said Allende. Allende, a well-known feminist, is related to Chile's socialist former President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a bloody coup in the 1970s by General Augusto Pinochet. Fleeing into exile after the coup, she has spent most of her life outside Chile, first in Venezuela and then in the United States. Salvador Allende's granddaughter, socialist lawmaker Maya Fernandez, was named by leftist Boric as his incoming defense minister, in what some have seen as an ironic twist of fate. \"Not only will she be a Chilean minister, she will be minister of defense,\" said Allende. \"She will have to deal with the Armed Forces and let's not forget about the past of the Armed Forces in Chile. I see it as a curious thing.\"","227":"SANTIAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - As Chile's incoming Cabinet stood for photos after being unveiled on Friday one could read in the captured image the changing face of the Andean country. The line-up was dominated by women - 14 out of 24 ministers - with seven of the Cabinet under the age of 40 and the youngest 32. The average age was 49. President-elect Gabriel Boric himself, a former student protest leader, will be just 36 when he takes office in March. \"Something has changed,\" Juan Gabriel Valdes, a former foreign minister, wrote on Twitter, posting two photos: one of the incoming Cabinet and another from the 1990 all-male government when Chile had just returned to democracy. Boric chose an experienced central banker as his finance minister, cheering markets. But an emphasis on political diversity and fresh ideas shows Chile's first Millennial leader also wants to stick to his campaign promises to shake things up. And the make-up of the Cabinet reflects a longer term shift in the role of Chilean women that harks back to former President Michelle Bachelet, who introduced a gender-balanced team in 2006. \"This cabinet is very important for us,\" said Karol Cariola, 34, a lawmaker for Chile's Communist Party, which is allied with Boric's broad leftist coalition. \"It can reflect not only Chile's diversity but also the need to progress to a decentralized country, a feminist country, one where we do not have limitations in political participation.\" Some analysts and conservative voters on Twitter said Boric's young team may struggle, though, given a lack of experience and a divided country, where the election saw an ultra-right rival candidate gain 44% in the second-round vote. Among the new ministers is Izkia Siches, 35, a prominent doctor who gained plaudits for her role in the country's COVID-19 pandemic response. She will take the interior minister role, where she will be confronted with voters' concerns over immigration and crime. Maya Fernandez Allende, the 50-year-old granddaughter of socialist former President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a bloody military coup in the 1970s by General Augusto Pinochet, will take over the defense portfolio. Marcela Hernando, 61, a centrist lawmaker, will be in charge of the mining sector in the world's top copper producer, while Maisa Rojas, 49, a well-respected climate scientist, will take over the ministry of environment. Boric has signaled a focus on climate and environmental protection. At the unveiling of his Cabinet, Boric said that the team would drive reform plans on pensions, education, health and on the environment. The administration faces significant challenges, however. Boric, Chile's youngest ever president, will oversee a referendum this year on a new constitution. Chileans angry at an economic model they say has helped the wealthy but left millions with poor-quality education and pensions staged sometimes violent protests in 2019 and may not give him much of a honeymoon. And he will have to deal with a split Congress where conservatives remain strong. \"One of the great challenges is going to be bringing together all the political forces in parliament,\" said Cariola.","228":"SANTIAGO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chile's leftist President-elect Gabriel Boric unveiled his Cabinet on Friday, throwing markets and investors a bone by picking current central bank head Mario Marcel to be the Andean country's finance minister. Boric also named Izkia Siches, a prominent doctor and part of his campaign team, as the interior minister and his deputy, as well as lawmaker Marcela Hernando for the key role of mining minister, where copper and lithium development will be in focus. The balanced make-up of the incoming government suggests Boric, a 35-year-old lawmaker and former student protest leader, may look to push gradual reforms rather than abrupt changes some had feared in the world's top copper producing nation. \"Naming Mario Marcel as finance minister is a very good sign of economic stability, seen positively by markets,\" said Miguel Angel Lopez, a public affairs professor at the University of Chile, adding it was a mix of coalition allies and technocrats. \"It's all linked to a much more centrist, more pragmatic shift in terms of what Boric wants to do in his government.\" The new government, which will take office on March 11, was made up of members of parties across the political spectrum, reflecting a fragmented and diverse Congress. Women will lead more than half of the ministries. Boric pledged during the election campaign to enact major reforms to Chile's market-led economic model, rattling investors, though he has moderated his tone since, boosting Chile's markets and currency. The peso currency strengthened early on Friday to under 800 per dollar for the first time since November. A select index of Chilean equities also rose more than 2%. 'GREAT REFORMS' Boric during the campaign pledged to \"bury\" Chile's market-orientated model, which has driven growth in the South American country in recent decades but has also deepened inequality, triggering months of social protests at the end of 2019. He has promised to reform the private pension and health systems and raise taxes to finance greater social spending. \"This Cabinet's mission is to lay the foundations for the great reforms that we have proposed in our program,\" Boric said after unveiling his ministers, adding that it would look to drive economic growth while cutting out \"structural inequalities.\" \"We are talking about sustainable growth accompanied by a fair redistribution of wealth,\" he said. Chile, a global front-runner in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, ended last year as the world's best-performing economy, buoyed by large state spending and several rounds of private pensions withdrawals to ease the impact of the pandemic. Boric will, however, have to contend with signs of an overheating economy and inflation, as well as a fragmented Congress, which analysts say will force him to seek consensus with more centrist sectors. \"One of Boric's biggest challenges will be cooling down the economy and retaining popular support,\" Oxford Economics said in a report, adding that the young leader would face pressure to increase social spending while meeting tighter budget targets.","229":"SANTIAGO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Chile, one of the world's fastest movers on COVID-19 vaccines, started its campaign to give fourth doses on Monday to immunocompromised people, a regional first, as infections rise driven by the fast spread of the Omicron variant. The South American country has seen daily infections rise to over 4,000, doubling over the last week, government data show, a reflection of soaring infections globally, despite hopes over data suggesting Omicron may be less fatal, if more contagious. \"This vaccine, this fourth dose or second booster dose, will be available to everyone. We start today with immunocompromised people and we will continue with maximum speed,\" said Chile's President Sebastian Pinera at a hospital in capital Santiago. The campaign began with people aged 12 or older with compromised immunity who received their first booster dose up until last September. The process will be extended to the general population of people aged over 55 years in February. \"This shows a great advance in terms of health issues,\" said Maria Isabel Sandoval, a 61-year-old retired teacher with cancer, who received her dose in a health center in the municipality of La Florida, in the southeast of the capital. \"It is like being a little bit ahead of things.\" Carla Riquelme, 37, a nurse technician who had breast cancer, agreed. \"As infections rise, it is ideal to get vaccinated again, to have more booster doses. I feel calmer,\" she said. Since the end of 2020, Chile has fully inoculated more than 14 million people - out of a population of 19 million - while 11.3 million people have already received a third booster dose, according to data from the Ministry of Health.","230":"SANTIAGO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A dead Chilean footballer is being celebrated the world over after his former team mates arranged for him to score a goal from his coffin as a farewell tribute to his striking prowess. Jaime Escandar died in the final days of 2021 but his friends with Chilean side Aparicion de Paine wanted to celebrate the life of the goalscoring forward. They positioned his coffin in the six-yard box and a team mate kicked the ball onto the coffin so it would rebound into the goal. Dozens of onlookers cheered enthusiastically as the ball hit the net. Some let off fireworks while friends dressed in Aparicion’s green shirt knelt and hugged the coffin draped with the team’s colours. Although little was known about the man, the video filmed on Jan. 3 in Huelquen, on the outskirts of Santiago, quickly went viral with sites across Latin America highlighting the passion and devotion shown by fans. \"He brought us together,\" said Felipe Orellana, who filmed the happy scene. \"What he leaves us is that unity ... We didn’t think (the video) would get shared all around the world because he was just an ordinary guy. “A very different goal, one that was celebrated with pity and tears,” Escandar’s club said in a Facebook post, adding that the centre forward “celebrated from heaven with all his soul.” “Your legacy will never be forgotten.”","231":"SANTIAGO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Chile will begin offering a fourth shot of the coronavirus vaccine next week to immunocompromised citizens, the government said on Thursday, the first country in Latin America and one of the first in the world to offer the extra dose. \"Starting next Monday, January 10, we are going to start a new mass vaccination process with a fourth dose or a second booster dose,\" said Pinera in a press conference. Chile has one of the world's highest vaccination rates and has been hailed as a model for its response to the pandemic, having administered two doses to over 85% of the population. About 57% have received a third booster shot, according to Our World in Data. Chile's announcement comes as the highly contagious Omicron variant is spreading worldwide, with several countries reporting all-time high COVID-19 case loads even among vaccinated populations. Cases in Mexico have more than doubled in the past week, while Peru imposed new restrictions this week. \"The success that Chile has had in the vaccination process (...) puts us among the best countries in the world in the way we have managed to combat this pandemic,\" Pinera added. \"And with this fourth dose we seek to maintain this leadership position and protect the health and lives of our compatriots.\" The vaccines for the fourth dose will be a combination of the same shots that have been used so far in Chile, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac and AstraZeneca, said Health Minister Enrique Paris. This combination of different vaccines between the first and fourth doses should allow \"an improvement in the immune response,\" Paris explained. Chile reported its first case of the Omicron variant at the beginning of December and has confirmed 698 cases of this variant have been reported, the vast majority corresponding to people who traveled outside the country.","232":"SANTIAGO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Four beekeepers were detained after protesting in front of Chile's presidential palace in Santiago on Monday, according to local officials, with seven police officers stung during the demonstrations. Honey production has been hurt by a long-term drought in Chile that has withered the bees' food sources such as flowers and crops. While drought is not uncommon in Chile, the current megadrought has persisted since 2010 and climate change is at least partly to blame, scientists say. The beekeepers want government reform to improve honey prices or to provide subsidies to honey producers. They have asked to meet with President Sebastian Pinera. The beekeepers set around 60 beehives, which contained an estimated 10,000 bees, on the avenue in front of the palace. One of the beekeepers, Jose Iturra, told local reporters that the drought in the Colina commune north of Santiago was killing the local bee population. \"Bees are dying,\" Iturra said. \"There would be no life if the bees die. That's what we wanted to highlight with this demonstration.\" A representative for the Ministry of Agriculture in the Santiago region said the agency was also concerned about the effect the drought was having on the bees. The government has been providing aid for months to 20 communities experiencing severe water shortages, Omar Guzman, the regional agricultural secretary, told reporters. Some passers-by were alarmed by the risk the bees posed to the public. \"It's dangerous for the people who are allergic (to bees) because they can cause death,\" one local said. Seven national police officers, called Carabiniers, were stung trying to arrest the beekeepers and move the beehives out of the street, police officials said, and were taken to the hospital. Droughts and rising temperatures from climate change have affected bee populations worldwide. A 2020 study published in the journal Science found that populations fell by around 50% in North America and 17% in Europe in one generation.","233":"WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Chile's free and fair elections set a \"powerful example\" for the region and the world, U.S. President Joe Biden told leftist leader Gabriel Boric, who won election this month as the country's youngest-ever democratically elected president.

The emphatic victory of progressive leftist Gabriel Boric over ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast left him elated. Kast's surprise rise in the polls - winning November's first round vote - stirred alarm among Chile's LGBTQ community, feminists and abortion rights activists, among others. The 55-year-old lawyer has opposed gay marriage, abortion and the emergency contraception \"morning-after pill,\" and he defended the 1973-1990 dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. During the campaign, he threatened to eliminate Chile's Women's Ministry before backtracking amid a barrage of criticism. \"As gay man I have my partner, and I had never really been scared for my life, for my rights,\" said Harting. \"The presidential race in Chile was a reminder of that fear.\" Harting said Kast's messages fueled hate in those who wanted to mistreat, marginalize and discriminate minorities. Kast's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Following his election win, Boric, who at 35 becomes Chile's youngest democratically-elected president, spoke to a sea of supporters who lined the streets of downtown Santiago: block after block of them waving pride, feminist and the indigenous Mapuche flags. \"Celebrating this victory meant everything to me!\" said Harting, who went with his partner and friends to hear Boric. \"It really tied into my life, my safety, the safety of my boyfriend, the safety of my friends, the safety of all the people I love in this world.\" Boric laid out broad plans to unite the nation and expand rights, mentioning indigenous rights, gender equality and the environment. He also promised fiscal responsibility and to nurture the economy. Paola Fernandez, 39, whose daughter is homosexual, said she was afraid of Kast's hard-right policies and conservative social agenda. \"Chile has already experienced a dictatorship and we could not live through one again,\" she said, hugging her daughter. \"My father-in-law was persecuted and exiled so we couldn't let a candidate like Jose Antonio Kast come to power.\" MORE STREET MOBILIZATION A native of Punta Arenas in Chile's far south, Boric as a student led the Federation of Students at the University of Chile in Santiago. He rose to prominence organizing protests in 2011 demanding improved and cheaper education. That was a precursor to a social uprising in 2019 that paved the way for hard-fought gains in rights and lit the fuse for the rise of the left and the redrafting of Chile's dictatorship-era constitution. After a decade-long legal battle, Chilean lawmakers legalized same-sex marriage this month, a milestone for a country that has long had a conservative reputation even compared with its Catholic Latin American peers. The rallies however often devolved into clashes with police, riots and looting, which served as a rallying cry for many Chileans frustrated with the movement and was fodder for Kast's tough law-and-order stance. Activists interviewed by Reuters said they would continue marching to press for further progress. \"What we've achieved we owe to the mass struggle, to occupying public spaces, actively mobilizing,\" said Pamela Valenzuela, spokesperson for the March 8 Feminist Coordinator (CF8M). \"So it's clear to us that we are going to continue mobilizing from a position of autonomy.\" The hundreds of thousands of Chilean women who hit the streets in recent years were key to achieving laws to penalize femicide, legalize abortion, and give women an equal voice in drafting the new constitution. Chile in 2017 legalized abortion for women under conditions where their life was in danger, a fetus was unviable or when a pregnancy had resulted from rape. But efforts to expand legal access have faced an uphill battle. In November, Chile's Lower Chamber of Congress rejected a bill that proposed legalizing termination of pregnancy up to 14 weeks. \"The president-elect in his program expressly says it: free, legal and safe abortion,\" said reproductive rights activist Gloria Maira. \"It has been our feminist slogan for decades.\" Despite Boric's promises of change, pushing through contentious policies could prove difficult with Congress evenly split between left and right after the November elections. \"President Boric's government will not be an easy one,\" said Maira. During the campaign, Boric said Chileans who had faced discrimination would be \"protagonists\" of his government. Gay rights activist Victor Hugo Robles said the appointment of an openly gay or trans minister would be a major statement. A gesture of that magnitude would \"symbolize change, freedom: revolution for the Chile of today and the Chile of the future,\" he said.","235":"Dec 22 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp (ALB.N) does not expect its Chilean lithium operations to be affected by President-elect Gabriel Boric's administration due to its long history in the country and \"unique\" contract to produce the electric vehicle battery metal. Boric, a 35-year-old leftist lawmaker who takes office in March, won Sunday's election by a double-digit margin on a platform of overhauling Chile's market-oriented economic system. He repeatedly criticized lithium industry privatization during the campaign. Chile has the world's largest reserves of lithium, most of which is found in brine that flows underneath the country's remote Atacama desert. The election results spooked investors, pushing down shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle and Chilean-based rival SQM (SQMA.SN) earlier this week. But Albemarle said it was unfazed and noted it has a contract to operate in Chile until at least 2043. \"We have been present in the country for more than 40 years and plan to be there for many more,\" Albemarle spokesperson Kelli Hopp-Michlosky said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday. \"In essence, we do not expect that the new administration will have any impacts on our operations in Chile.\" Albemarle noted that Boric said during the campaign he didn't plan to nationalize lithium operations and would look instead to create a national lithium company. Chile's government already operates Codelco, the world's largest copper producer. Albemarle also noted it pays a lithium royalty rate that can be as high as 40%, the highest lithium royalty in the world,  gives money to communities living near its operations and funds water level studies. \"We remain committed to maintaining our strong relationships in Chile, producing sustainable lithium for the world and generating development for the country,\" Hopp-Michlosky said. \"We have a unique, long-term contract with the state of Chile.\"","236":"SANTIAGO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Chile's markets steadied on Tuesday after sharp falls a day earlier in the wake of a resounding presidential election victory by leftist Gabriel Boric, who has pledged to shake up the country's market-oriented economic model.

The 35-year-old leftist lawmaker singled out the planned Dominga mine, which critics say could devastate La Higuera, a coastal ecosystem rich in biodiversity with a large number of marine mammals and birds. The project's owner, privately held Andes Iron, has long rejected that assertion. Boric, who takes office in March, campaigned on a pledge to overhaul Chile's market-oriented economic model, but details on his stance toward mining were thin. His comments on Sunday signaled that environmental regulation may be where he looks to make the biggest difference. \"We don't want more 'sacrifice zones' (areas of high pollution), we don't want projects that destroy our country, destroy communities and we exemplify a case that has been symbolic: No to Dominga,\" Boric said. Shares of mining companies dropped sharply on Monday, including Chile-focused lithium miners Albemarle (ALB.N) and SQM (SQMA.SN), amid a wider market retreat.  read more  Prices for copper, Chile's major export, are at record highs, which has whetted the appetite of legislators around the region to push for a bigger share of profits to pay for economic recoveries after the coronavirus pandemic. In neighboring Peru, the new leftist administration of President Pedro Castillo has given communities stronger backing in a spate of protests against mining firms, often over allegations they pollute local lands and water.  read more  \"If there is something that can have a real impact on the mining industry, in my opinion, we should start looking at the environmental issues,\" said Santiago-based Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of consultancy Plusmining. Chile has the world's largest reserves of lithium, the ultra-light battery metal that is mined using brine from beneath pristine salt flats in the Atacama desert, where regulation around water use is already under scrutiny. Boric has criticized privatization in the sector and wants a state lithium firm. The Andean nation is the world's top producer of copper and the No. 2 producer of lithium, a major ingredient of batteries used in electric vehicles. Both metals are seeing sharp price rises on soaring demand and a global rush to secure supply. Chile is already debating higher taxes on mining firms - something Boric supports - as well as a stalled bill to protect glaciers in the mineral rich Andes. The industry says that measure, if unchanged, would risk current mines and obstruct new ones. It could impact the Andina and El Teniente mines of state company Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, as well as Anglo American's (AAL.L) Los Bronces, Los Pelambres of Antofagasta (ANTO.L) and Caserones, linked to JX Nippon Mining. The National Mining Society (Sonami), representing companies in the sector, declined to comment on the president-elect's remarks on Sunday or about the outlook for Dominga. \"It is clear that the new wealth and environmental taxes are on the horizon, while the presidency will support plans to raise royalties on mining firms,\" said consulting Teneo in a report. Boric, who has moderated his tone in recent weeks to win over centrist voters, did say environmental adjustments would have to be gradual. \"Not everything can be done at the same time and we will have to prioritize to make progress that allows us to improve, step by step, the lives of our people,\" he said.","238":"SANTIAGO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric on Monday pledged to maintain an \"orderly economy\" and to move swiftly on naming a Cabinet, a day after a sweeping electoral victory propelled him to become Chile's youngest-ever democratically elected president.

In his victory speech on Sunday, he touched upon indigenous rights, gender equality and the environment, though he also talked about fiscal responsibility and said he would look after the economy. He took aim, however, at mining projects that hurt the environment. \"We have an enormous challenge. I know that in the coming years, the future of our country is at stake, so I guarantee that I will be a president who cares for democracy and does not risk it,\" he said. \"I will firmly fight against the privileges of the few, and I will work every day for the quality of the Chilean family.\" Progressives in Chile partied into the early hours of Monday with thousands taking to the streets with flags and banners in capital Santiago to celebrate the election win. \"I'm very excited because this is an achievement of the people. There have been many years of abuse, and we need a renovation within politics,\" said Boric supporter Patricia Garrido amid crowds celebrating on the streets of the capital. \"I have a lot of faith and hope in the youth.\" Leftist leaders around the region cheered his win: Alberto Fernandez in Argentina, Luis Arce in Bolivia, Brazilian former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Pedro Castillo - another outsider leftist who became Peru's president in July. \"It's spectacular. At one point, we thought it was going to be closer. Luckily fascism didn't win from the current far-right,\" said Andres Rodriguez, another Boric supporter. \"There is a big project behind what we are proposing: we want to unify the system and equalize things a bit.\" Despite a campaign that at times turned heated between the two polar-opposite candidates, Kast quickly recognized the win, congratulating Boric and calling for the result to be respected, important as the country tries to heal and unify. \"I'm super-excited,\" said Cristian Aburto, a Boric supporter who was working in a polling station. \"I think the most important thing is seeing the people here together.

That imbalance sparked widespread angry social uprisings in 2019, lighting the fuse for the political rise of the progressive left and the redrafting of the country's dictatorship-era constitution. \"If Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it will also be its grave,\" Boric said when he won the candidacy of his leftist bloc. \"Do not be afraid of the youth changing this country.\" A native of Punta Arenas, in Chile's far south, Boric as a student led the Federation of Students at the University of Chile in Santiago. He rose to prominence leading protests in 2011 demanding improved and cheaper education. By 2014, still in his 20s, he had joined the national Congress as a lower-house lawmaker, representing Chile's vast and sparsely populated southernmost region of Magallanes. With thick black hair and a trimmed beard, he is more groomed now than in his student leader days. Although a known face of the left in Chile, Boric was initially a dark-horse candidate for the presidency. He just reached the threshold of 35,000 signatures needed to be a candidate. But then he beat out the popular Santiago-region  mayor, Daniel Jadue, of the Communist Party, to lead the leftist alliance. Boric has since looked to distance himself from some of the more extreme views of far-left groups in his alliance, including support from the Communist Party for the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro. Buoyed by youthful supporters, there has been a deluge of online memes backing him. High-profile supporters include Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal from \"The Mandalorian\" and Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal. Former two-term Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, now the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, backed Boric, saying he would put Chile on a \"path of progress for all, of greater freedom, equality and human rights.\" Leftists around the region flocked to congratulate Boric. \"I congratulate @gabrielboric for his election as president of Chile,\" said Brazilian former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist who is looking to make a comeback in elections next year. \"I'm happy for another victory of a democratic and progressive candidate in our Latin America.\"","240":"SANTIAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric won the country's presidential runoff election on Sunday, capping a major revival for the country's progressive left that has been on the rise since widespread protests roiled the Andean country two years ago.

With over 99% of ballots counted, Boric, 35, who leads a broad leftist coalition, had 55.86% of the vote, compared with  44.14% for far-right rival Jose Antonio Kast, who conceded defeat. \"I just spoke to @gabrielboric and congratulated him on his great success,\" Kast said on Twitter. \"From today he is the elected President of Chile and he deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration. Chile is always first.\" The protests in 2019 shone a spotlight on economic inequality and triggered an official redraft of the constitution. \"I am going to be the president of all Chileans,\" Boric said in a call with center-right President Sebastian Pinera, who will step down in March. Lucrecia Cornejo, 72, a seamstress, backed Boric's pledge to fix inequalities in education, pensions and healthcare. \"I want equality, for us not to be as they call us, the 'broken ones,' more fairness in education, health and salaries,\" she said. \"I want real change.\" The election was the nation's most divisive in decades, with the two candidates offering starkly different visions of the future. Kast, 55, ran a law-and-order campaign and was a defender of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Often likened to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a hero of Chile's \"unapologetic right,\"Kast has said that \"two models for the nation\" were going head-to-head. Both candidates were from outside the centrist political mainstream that has ruled Chile since the return to democracy in 1990 after Pinochet's military dictatorship. Both moderated their positions in recent weeks to win over centrist voters. Miguel Angel Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, said Boric faced a complex period ahead and would have to negotiate with the opposition due to a split Congress where neither side has a majority. \"He now has to make a strong speech where he tries to end the uncertainty. Lots will depend on that and on his appointments and his decisions. International investors will be very attentive to this.\" Boric supporters say he will overhaul the country's economic model that dates back to Pinochet. It has been credited for driving economic growth, but attacked for creating sharp divides between rich and poor. \"We can close the chapter on the dark, damaging and abusive model that benefited a small minority,\" said businessman Jorge Valdivia, 54, a Boric supporter. Boric, who rose to prominence leading a student protest in 2011 to demand better and more affordable education, wrote in an open letter on Saturday that his government would make the changes Chileans had demanded in the 2019 social uprisings. Those protests, which lasted months and at times turned violent, sparked a formal process to redraft Chile's decades-old constitution, a text that will face a referendum next year. \"(That means) having a real social security system that doesn't leave people behind, ending the hateful gap between healthcare for the rich and healthcare for the poor, advancing without hesitation in freedoms and rights for women,\" Boric wrote.","241":"SANTIAGO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric has widened his lead in the final polls ahead of the Andean country's presidential election on Sunday, though the polarized race remains tight against ultra-conservative rival Jose Antonio Kast. Ahead of the run-off ballot, two private polls seen by Reuters showed 35-year-old former student protest leader Boric edging ahead of Kast, 55, a far-right lawyer who has defended the legacy of military dictator Augusto Pinochet. Chile, the world's top copper producer and long a role model of market-oriented economic policy in Latin America, is set for its most divisive presidential ballot in decades, with both candidates from outside the centrist mainstream parties. A private poll from Cadem, which surveyed 1,007 people with a margin of error of 3.1%, showed Boric taking 55% of the vote versus 45% for Kast, widening his lead over the last week when a similar poll showed him with 52% versus 48% for Kast. A second poll by consulting firm Atlas Intel, which had shown a draw earlier in the week, now put Boric ahead with 51% voting preferences versus 49% for Kast. The survey included 4,062 people with a margin of error of 1%. The country is in a two-week blackout period where pollsters cannot openly publish surveys on the vote, but private polls are often commissioned. The first opinion polls after the Nov. 21 first round vote had favored Boric, though that lead had appeared to be narrowing until the most recent surveys.","242":"SANTIAGO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Chilean voters are split on what they want from the future ahead of a landmark presidential election on Sunday between polarized candidates - one offering social change and the other pledging to get tough on law and order. The election will see ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast and leftist Gabriel Boric go head-to-head after closing their campaigns this week, where they looked to win over middle-ground voters who could make the difference in a tight race. \"What is at stake now in Chile is democracy itself,\" said housewife Julia Acevedo, 80, who attended 35-year-old Boric's closing campaign in the capital. \"The country needs change and he, who is young, can make a difference.\" Kast supporters, on the other hand, want stability. They say Boric - who has taken aim at Chile's market-oriented economic model for stoking inequality - will undo decades of growth and stability and criticize his alliance with the Communist Party. \"I will keep supporting freedom,\" said Margarita Noguera, waving a Chilean flag stamped with a picture of 55-year-old Kast. She said she had lived through the \"leftist dictatorship\" of democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende in the 1970s. \"I suffered a lot, like so many other Chileans.\" Angela Marambio, 53, said she had backed a center-right candidate in the first round in November, but was switching her vote to Kast for the run-off. \"Chile needs stability, order and security,\" she said. Kast, a lawyer and religious father of nine, has defended the economic legacy of dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose bloody military rule from 1973-1990 overthrew Allende in a coup and established the country's economic model. Huge protests erupted in 2019 against that model, which many see as the reason for issues ranging from meager private pensions to expensive healthcare and education. Cristian Morales, 51, a public official from Punta Arenas in Chile's southern tip, Boric's home region, said the leftist candidate could finally change things. \"I do not believe he will be able to make all the changes that are needed, but he will accelerate the process,\" said Morales, citing plans for spending on pensions and education. \"If I were to retire tomorrow I'd fall under the poverty line. I have two young children, education is expensive. If we want more solidarity in society, the state has to get involved.\" Boric, who made his name leading student demonstrations for better quality education, has sought to channel the energy and demand for change sparked by Chile's 2019 protests. Kast has done the opposite, with a tough law and order message that has appealed to a significant segment of the country weary of protests. Enrique Zuleta, 41, a businessman from the coastal city of La Serena, said for years he voted for the center-left coalition that governed much of the post-dictatorship period and gave Chile a reputation for stability. Now he is backing Kast. \"I did not grow up in a right-wing environment at all, but today my vote is pragmatic, for the national good,\" he said. \"Kast has many ideological issues with which I do not agree. But... he has said that he will respect the laws. And that is important to me.\" Boric supporters say he will defend issues such as women's rights to abortion - allowed only in certain circumstances  - and will respect sexual diversity, in focus after the country this month approved same-sex marriage. Kast has criticized both abortion and gay marriage. Polls indicate women, especially younger women, are more likely to vote for Boric. \"I am afraid of Kast,\" said Andrea Ramirez, a 26-year-old public administrator. \"He worries me about the environment, the role of the state, the pensions of Chileans. And what rights will women have?\"","243":"SANTIAGO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Chilean Mireya Garcia, 64, feels there is more at stake than usual in this Sunday's presidential election.

For Garcia and many of her generation, this, the most polarized of Chile's elections since its return to democracy in 1990, has opened old wounds. Garcia's brother was forcibly disappeared in 1977 during the dictatorship and Kast's praise of Pinochet has angered her. \"The coup totally destroyed our family and we were never the same,\" Garcia told Reuters. \"This has unexpectedly turned into one of the most closely-fought elections and what is at stake is that on the one hand the extreme right is clearly a danger for Chile and on the other hand, there is a candidate who represents the youth,\" said Garcia. Older Chileans lived through the tumultuous years of socialist President Salvador Allende, the 1973 coup that ousted him and ended his life, and the bloody 17-year military dictatorship that followed. Since the dictatorship ended, Chilean elections have generally pitted moderate leftists against center-right candidates. The country has been known as an island of stability and orthodox policies in Latin America. Now the old, deep divisions between the socialist left and far-right seem to be resurfacing. Kast has praised Pinochet's market-oriented \"economic legacy\" and appealed to voters with proposals seemingly taken from the playbook of right-wing populist leaders like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and former U.S. President Donald Trump, such as building a ditch to curb illegal immigration. On Thursday night, Kast promised thousands of supporters at a rally that he would bring order, after protests in 2019 saw buildings around capital Santiago burned and thousands injured in conflicts with the police. \"Chile is not and will never be a communist or Marxist nation,\" he said - a dig at Boric, who is allied with Chile's Communist Party within a wide leftist coalition. The historical parallel was not lost on Kast's supporters. \"I'm from the 1973 generation, I experienced the Popular Unity party, I experienced Salvador Allende and it was chaotic,\" said 67-year-old pensioner Aurora Oviedo, a Kast supporter. \"We didn't have anything to eat and we had to wait in line for everything.\" Democratically-elected Allende, a Marxist, was overthrown by Pinochet in the 1973 coup. During Pinochet's 17-year time in power, more than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared and tens of thousands tortured. \"I was young, I took to the streets to call on the armed forces,\" said Oviedo, adding that she attended the Kast rally because she does not want a \"communist\" to become president. In an unexpected twist of fate that has also brought reminders of the dictatorship's legacy, Pinochet's widow Lucia Hiriart died on Thursday at the age of 99. In response, hundreds of people thronged to a Santiago plaza, waving flags and chanting, some bearing the photos of those disappeared by the military regime. Manuel Valenzuela, 78, holding a portrait of Allende in his hands, was among them. The widow's passing was \"divine justice\" and hopefully it would serve as a lightning rod to get people out to vote for Boric, said Valenzuela, a former political exile. The run-off vote is also the first presidential decider since the 2019 protests against economic inequalities that eventually sparked a still ongoing process to undo one of the main remaining vestiges of the dictatorship: a revamp of Chile's constitution. But both candidates have moderated as the race has tightened, seeking to win over centrist voters. Congress, elected in November, is split down the middle between left and right, creating a likely brake on radical reform. Older Chileans are quick to point out that despite the political vitriol things are nowhere near as bad as they were in 1973. During Allende's government Maria Angelica Quezada, 68, said she was turned away from the supermarket because she did not belong to the local political party. \"I didn't have the right to eat, to shop because I wasn't registered in the party,\" said Quezada, who plans to vote for Kast. \"Things are more relaxed now,\" she said. Berta Vilche, a 73-year-old retired lawyer and Boric supporter, said that \"when people talk about how polarized our society is they don't know what they're talking about.\" \"Today's polarization has nothing to do with what was going on back then. The coup was really, really terrible.\"","244":"NEW YORK\/SANTIAGO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Chile's presidential election, the most polarized in decades, has given markets the wobbles. But there may be a silver lining for investors within the stark divides: buffers from a split Congress and candidates' moderating stances to lure key centrist voters. The Sunday head-to-head sees leftist former student protest leader Gabriel Boric take on far-right Jose Antonio Kast, both from outside the mainstream political parties who have risen on the back of voter anger and demand for change. Boric has threatened to bury Chile's neoliberal economic model that dates to the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Kast, oft likened to Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, has joked about having Pinochet over for tea. But both candidates have moderated as the race has tightened to win over key moderate votes. Congress, elected in November, is split down the middle between left and right, creating a likely brake on radical reform. \"Both candidates have been making major adjustments to their programs, they have introduced concepts of prudence and realism,\" Chile's central bank president, Mario Marcel, said this week, adding that would be valuable reassuring investors. J.P. Morgan in a report said it had noted \"a turn to moderation\" by both candidates. Congress, it said, would temper Boric's policy plans if he were to win, while a left-leaning assembly redrafting the constitution would pressure Kast. Nonetheless, the uncertainty has hit Chile's assets hard. The peso  has tumbled 16% this year versus the dollar, among the weakest emerging markets currencies. The dollar-denominated Chile MSCI stock index (.MICL00000PUS) is down 14%. Wary Chileans have been pulling assets out of the country over the last two years, partly the effect of the pandemic, but uncertainty was also sparked by a social unrest breakout in 2019 and the current constitutional reform process. Some $10 billion in household and company wealth has flowed out of Chile this year, according to central bank data through November, on top of the $12 billion that exited last year. The number was closer to $2 billion in 2018 and 2019. \"These capital outflows, so far, have been quite similar to those that occurred during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009,\" Marcel said. \"They are important numbers, no doubt.\" 'WILD CARD' The election - currently too close to call with some polls showing a dead heat - will see Chileans choose from two very different visions of the future for the world's top copper producer and a bastion of stability in volatile Latin America. \"Chile's upcoming presidential election is the most divisive since the country's transition to democracy,\" Standard Chartered Bank said in a note, referring to the end of the dictatorship in 1990. But for many, the constitutional redraft, which will see a national referendum on the new text next year, poses even larger risks. If approved it would likely shift away somewhat from the market-driven Pinochet era text, which underpinned Chile's economic model penned by the so-called Chicago Boys. \"The wild card in Chile is the constituent assembly and the new constitution,\" said Carlos de Sousa, emerging market debt strategist at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. Mining could be central to that. Areas like taxation are coming under scrutiny as are environmental protections, which could impact copper and lithium, an ultra-light battery metal in big demand due to the shift to electric vehicles. \"The Constitutional Convention and presidential election have put mining investments on hold,\" said Alvaro Merino, chief of studies at the National Mining Association (Sonami). He said Chile has a portfolio of $69 billion in investments over the next 10 years, which needed regulations that provide legal certainty, stability and do not compromise competitiveness. \"We need to clear up uncertainties so that mining investment is deployed with full force,\" he said. A tough external factor for Chile is the outlook for emerging markets as developed economies move to abandon years of loose monetary policy. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States has already dried portfolio flows into some EMs. Vontobel's de Sousa said Chilean assets could be worth a bet because the peso was so weak right now, but rising political risks would give him pause for thought. \"Strategically, on a long-term perspective, we don't like Chile much right now,\" he said.","245":"SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Lucia Hiriart, the widow of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, died on Thursday at the age of 99, her family said. Her death came three days before a polarized presidential election in Chile in which one of the candidates defends the legacy of the military regime. Hiriart aroused strong reactions among Chileans for the perceived influence she had on Pinochet and for the fortune accumulated by her family. Her estate managed a controversial foundation, which was subjected to several judicial probes. \"At the age of 99 and surrounded by family and loved ones, my beloved grandmother passed away. She leaves an immense mark on our hearts,\" her granddaughter, who goes as Karina Pinochet on Twitter, posted on the social network. \"She gave her life to the service of Chileans and history will know how to value her great work and her work for our beloved country. Rest in Peace.\" Pinochet, a military general, overthrew the nation's democratically elected government in a bloody 1973 coup. During his 17-year reign, more then 3,000 people were killed or disappeared and tens of thousands tortured. During the dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s, Chile also established much of its current market-oriented economic system, which helped drive decades of growth but also spurred inequality. In a biography by the journalist Alejandra Matus, Hiriart is portrayed as a tough character who often criticized her husband. The two were married from 1943 to 2006, when Pinochet died. Chile will vote for a new president on Sunday between leftist Gabriel Boric and ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast, who has previously defended Pinochet's legacy and said the former dictator would have voted for him if he were still alive.","246":"SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chile's ultra-right presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast and leftist Gabriel Boric appear to be tied among likely voters ahead of the country's polarized runoff election on Sunday, according to a poll seen by Reuters on Thursday. Kast, who won a partial majority in the first round on Nov. 21, has 48.5% of the voting intention, ahead of Boric with 48.4%, according to a survey of 2,218 potential voters conducted by consulting group AtlasIntel. When non-valid votes are removed, each candidate would end up with 50% of the vote. A little over 15 million Chileans can vote in Sunday's election. In the first round, Kast, a conservative lawmaker, won 27.9% of the votes and Boric 25.8%. The first opinion polls after the initial round favored leftist politician and former student movement leader Boric by several points, but that lead has diminished in recent days. In AtlasIntel's previous poll, which surveyed 2,692 likely voters at the beginning of December, Boric had led with 41% versus Kast at 38.7%, or by 51.5% versus Kast's 48.5% when only valid votes were counted. The country is in a two-week blackout period where pollsters cannot publicly publish surveys on the vote, but private polls are often commissioned.","247":"SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chile is set to vote for a new president on Sunday, with a young former student leader Gabriel Boric on the left battling far-right conservative Jose Antonio Kast, in the most polarized election since the country's return to democracy in 1990. An at times heated campaign has seen Kast play up Boric's alliance with the Andean country's Communist Party, while Kast himself has come under fire for his defense of the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet that ended three decades ago. The run-off vote is the first presidential decider since Chile was rocked in 2019 by months of angry protests against economic inequalities that eventually sparked a process - still ongoing - to redraft its decades-old constitution. \"What we're seeing here is a debate stuck in the cold war trenches, of communism versus fascism,\" said Kenneth Bunker, director of consultancy Tresquintos, who said the \"virulence and polarization\" could put some voters off. \"It's the old left-right divide.\" HOW WILL THE VOTE WORK? The winner-takes-all Dec. 19 election will see Chileans vote for a new president after a fragmented first-round ballot in mid-November also chose members of Congress and regional councils. The voting starts at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and ballot stations close around 6 p.m., with results expected to come in fairly quickly Sunday evening. The two candidates going head-to-head are 55-year-old ultra-right former congressman Kast, who is just behind in opinion polls against Boric, 35, a former leader student running for a leftist coalition. There had been seven candidates in the November first round, with votes from the more centrist runners on the right and left seen as key to deciding which way the vote will go. Pollsters expect a close race, with Boric slightly ahead in pre-election polls since Kast came top in a fragmented first round vote. More moderate voters, the polls show, have swung to Boric more than Kast though the gap is narrowing. However, history is potentially against Boric. Since 1999, the winner of the first round vote has always gone on to win the second round run-off. WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES? Many Chileans support the free-market policies that propelled the copper-rich country to decades of growth and made it a bastion of economic stability in volatile Latin America. But an increasing number want change to address the deep inequalities. Some of the loudest demands have stemmed from anger over paltry retirement payouts blamed by critics on Chile's highly privatized pension system, while others have criticized the high costs and sometimes dubious quality of privatized education, and gaps between public and private healthcare. Conservative voters have raised questions about increased immigration, and there are law and order concerns sparked by the protests in the capital and violent clashes between police and Mapuche indigenous groups in the country's south. Whoever wins the presidency will also have to handle a referendum to approve or reject the text of a new constitution during their first year in office. An assembly, dominated by leftist and independent representatives, is leading the constitution redraft. Despite a polarized presidential race, markets took solace from the congressional result in November, with a fairly even balance between parties on the left and right likely to moderate the power of the executive branch and any radical reforms. \"(The winner) is going to have to face a Congress different from the current one, a more balanced congress, almost split in two halves,\" said Marco Moreno, director of the school of government from the Central University of Chile.","248":"SANTIAGO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Chilean ultra-conservative presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast, sometimes likened to Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro and a defender of former dictator General Augusto Pinochet, is riding a wave of voter anger and fear over immigration and crime. The 55-year-old lawyer, a Catholic and father of nine, will compete against leftist lawmaker Gabriel Boric, twenty years his junior, in a polarized and delicately balanced run-off election on Sunday. He is marginally behind in opinion polls. Although softly spoken, Kast promises a tough approach on crime and a streamlined state. He has attacked Boric over his alliance with Chile's Communist Party within a wide leftist coalition and posed himself as a defender of stability. \"This December we won't just elect a president, we will choose between liberty and communism,\" he said in a speech after he came top in the first-round vote in November. He has since softened his rhetoric, helping win over some moderate voters and narrow the gap on Boric, but has kept a focus on law and order. \"Tough times are coming and a government that provides stability is required, one that speaks the truth,\" Kast said in the final debate with Boric on Monday night. The candidate for the right-wing Christian Social Front coalition, Kast has praised the legacy of Pinochet, whose bloody rule in the 1970s and 1980s established much of Chile's market-oriented economic system. That chimes with some voters, who still admire the former dictator. \"If he were alive he would vote for me,\" he told local newspaper La Tercera in 2017 when campaigning then - unsuccessfully - to be president. \"If I had met him now, we would have had a cup of tea at La Moneda (presidential palace).\" Kast has played up his credentials as a flagbearer of Chile's \"unapologetic\" right wing, which has hardened in response to the rise of the progressive political left in the wake of angry and sometimes violent street protests in 2019. \"They call us intolerant and extreme, because we speak the truth and say things head-on. Unlike the left, we have never endorsed violence,\" Kast wrote on Twitter in October. The conservative has pledged to build back economic growth and \"restore\" order after the 2019 protests, which saw buildings around capital Santiago burned and thousands injured in street conflicts with the police. Critics say his treatment of the political class - he has called Congress a \"circus\" - and proposals that have included building a ditch to curb illegal immigration are reminiscent of right-wing populist leaders like Bolsonaro and former U.S. President Donald Trump. He has downplayed those comparisons. \"We want to unite, we want to dialogue with everyone, regardless of political hue,\" he told business leaders last month. \"I am a direct and frank person, but I am always respectful.\"","249":"SANTIAGO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Former student protest leader and leftist lawmaker Gabriel Boric has his sights set on winning Chile's presidential election on Sunday, which would make the 35-year-old the Andean country's youngest ever leader and cap the return of the progressive left. The former law student, leading a leftist coalition of the broad Frente Amplio and the Communist Party, has been marginally ahead in opinion polls against ultra-right rival Jose Antonio Kast in the run-up to the Dec. 19 winner-takes-all vote. \"You can count on me, I am going to act firmly to bring this country together again,\" he told voters in a televised debate against Kast on Monday night, where he toned down earlier fiery rhetoric and spoke of the \"stability\" many moderate voters are seeking. Boric, who rose to prominence leading student protests in 2011 demanding better and cheaper education, has tapped into public anger at Chile's \"neo-liberal\" market-oriented policies, widely considered to have helped drive decades of rapid economic growth but also to have stoked inequality. That imbalance sparked widespread angry social uprisings in 2019, lighting the fuse for the political rise of the progressive left and the redrafting of the country's dictatorship-era constitution. \"If Chile was the cradle of neo-liberalism, it will also be its grave,\" Boric said when he won the candidacy for his leftist bloc. \"Do not be afraid of the youth changing this country.\" A native of Punta Arenas, in Chile's far south, Boric as a student led the influential Federation of Students at the University of Chile in Santiago. By 2014, still in his twenties, he had joined the national Congress as a lower house lawmaker, representing Chile's vast and sparsely populated southernmost region of Magallanes. With thick black hair and a trimmed beard, he is more groomed now than in his disheveled student leader days. Although a known face of the left in Chile, Boric was initially a dark horse candidate for the presidency. He just reached the threshold of 35,000 signatures needed to be a candidate. But then he beat out the popular capital mayor Daniel Jadue - of the Communist Party - to lead the leftist alliance. He has since looked to distance himself from some more extreme views from far-left groups in his alliance, including support from the Communist Party for the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro. Buoyed by youthful supporters, there has been a deluge of online memes backing him. High profile supporters include Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal from \"The Mandalorian\" and Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal. Former two-term Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, now the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, gave Boric her backing this week. \"What is going to be decided this coming Sunday is fundamental. No one can remain indifferent,\" she said in a video message urging people to vote. \"Choose a president who ensures our country can truly continue on a path of progress for all, of greater freedom, equality, and human rights that are respected, a sustainable environment and of course the chance for a new constitution.\""},"Fecha":{"0":"May 30, 202310:21 PM UTCUpdated  ago","1":"May 19, 20236:14
